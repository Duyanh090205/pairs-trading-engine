## 1. Objective

The engine measures when two equity prices diverge from their historical equilibrium and generates a directional signal to trade the reversion. The signal must be:

- **Causal** — no bar in the trading period may use information from a later bar
- **Scalable** — vectorized Z-score computation, O(n) state machine
- **Auditable** — every parameter traceable to formation data; no ad hoc tuning

The formation period (Jan–Jun 2022) is used exclusively for parameter estimation. The trading period (Jul–Dec 2022) applies those parameters without modification.

---

## 2. Data

### Session filter

Raw data contains pre-market and after-hours bars. These are removed by converting to `America/New_York` timezone and retaining only bars where the local time is between 09:30 and 15:59 inclusive. DST transitions are handled correctly by the tz-aware filter: during EDT (UTC-4, Apr–Oct) the session maps to UTC 13:30–19:59; during EST (UTC-5, Nov–Mar) it maps to UTC 14:30–20:59.

**Why this matters:** An incorrect UTC-fixed filter cuts the first hour of every summer session, losing 60 bars/day and biasing the half-life estimate.

### Pair alignment

Both legs are aligned on a shared DatetimeIndex using an inner join. Bars where either leg has a missing close are dropped. Volume and OHLC data are retained but only the close price is used in the signal engine.

| Pair | Total bars (full year) | Formation bars | Trading bars |
|------|----------------------:|---------------:|-------------:|
| CMS / DUK | 96,770 | 47,889 | 48,881 |
| DOW / LYB | 96,770 | 47,889 | 48,881 |

## 3. Spread Construction

### 3.1 Log-price spread model

The spread is defined as:

```
S(t) = log(A_t) - alpha - beta * log(B_t)
```

Using log prices instead of raw prices makes the relationship scale-invariant and the regression errors approximately homoskedastic. The hedge ratio `beta` is the elasticity of leg A with respect to leg B in log-price space.

### 3.2 OLS hedge ratio (formation period only)

The model `log(A) = alpha + beta * log(B) + epsilon` is fit via OLS on the formation period using `numpy.linalg.lstsq`. The estimator is numerically stable and requires no scipy dependency.

**Formation period only — no lookahead.** Calling OLS on the full year or the trading period would incorporate future prices into the hedge ratio and invalidate every spread, Z-score, and signal computed thereafter.

| Parameter | CMS/DUK | DOW/LYB |
|-----------|--------:|--------:|
| alpha (intercept) | -0.6956 | -0.8770 |
| beta (hedge ratio) | 1.0487 | 1.0828 |

A positive beta near 1.0 is economically expected for utility pairs (CMS, DUK) and chemical pairs (DOW, LYB) — same sector, similar capital structure, correlated earnings drivers.

**OLS direction asymmetry.** Regressing log(A) on log(B) yields a different beta than regressing log(B) on log(A) — the two estimates are not reciprocals unless the fit is perfect. Measuring this asymmetry on the formation period:

| Pair | beta (A on B) | beta (B on A, reciprocal) | Asymmetry | % gap |
|------|:-------------:|:-------------------------:|:---------:|:-----:|
| CMS/DUK | 1.0487 | 1.1083 | 0.0596 | 5.7% |
| DOW/LYB | 1.0828 | 1.1782 | 0.0954 | 8.8% |

The chosen direction (log(A) on log(B)) is standard for the Engle-Granger framework — it matches the Week 1 scan convention, making the hedge ratio directly comparable to the cointegration test. For CMS/DUK (5.7% gap) the practical effect on spread construction is small. For DOW/LYB (8.8% gap) it is non-trivial: a beta mis-stated by ~0.095 adds `0.095 × log(LYB_t)` as structural noise to every spread observation. This is a contributing factor to the DOW/LYB z_std anomaly documented in Section 7.2. Total Least Squares (TLS via PCA) would eliminate the asymmetry but was not required at this stage given the EG-aligned convention.

## 4. Spread Characterization

### 4.1 Cointegration evidence (Week 1 Engle-Granger scan)

The pairs in this engine were selected in Week 1 via an Engle-Granger cointegration scan across 32,000+ candidate pairs. The Engle-Granger procedure runs an ADF test on OLS residuals — it is the standard formal stationarity test for a cointegration-based pairs strategy.

| Pair | Category | EG t-statistic | Raw p-value | Interpretation |
|------|----------|:--------------:|:-----------:|----------------|
| CMS/DUK | Primary | -5.268 | 0.000051 | Strongly rejects no-cointegration |
| DOW/LYB | Secondary | -4.861 | 0.000294 | Strongly rejects no-cointegration |
| A/AFL | Alternative | -5.290 | 0.000047 | Strongly rejects |
| AVGO/GLD | Alternative | -4.346 | 0.002170 | Rejects at 5% |
| DDOG/FOXA | Alternative | -5.727 | 0.000006 | Strongly rejects |
| HD/MS | Alternative | -4.556 | 0.000989 | Strongly rejects |
| LOW/MS | Alternative | -4.177 | 0.003957 | Rejects at 5% |
| DHI/LVS | Alternative | -4.868 | 0.000286 | Strongly rejects |
| GOOG/GOOGL | Benchmark | -5.283 | 0.000048 | Strongly rejects |
| CVNA/ISRG | Neg. control | +0.778 | 0.993811 | Fails — no cointegration evidence |
| INTC/JPM | Neg. control | +0.132 | 0.988546 | Fails — no cointegration evidence |

**BH correction note:** Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-values did not pass the rejection threshold for most pairs in the universe scan. This is expected — the BH procedure controls the False Discovery Rate across 32,000 pairs simultaneously, making it conservative at the pair level. The individual test statistics and raw p-values are the appropriate evidence for a pair that was already selected on economic grounds (same sector, similar market cap, correlated fundamentals). The appropriate framing is **"candidate cointegrated pairs with strong individual test evidence"** rather than "confirmed cointegrated."

The negative controls confirm the engine: CVNA/ISRG (t=+0.78) and INTC/JPM (t=+0.13) both have near-zero or positive test statistics, failing to reject the null of no cointegration. These are correctly identified as non-pairs.

### 4.2 Half-life (Ornstein-Uhlenbeck)

If the spread is mean-reverting, it follows an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process:

```
dS = -kappa * S * dt + sigma * dW
```

The half-life is `HL = log(2) / kappa`. We estimate `kappa` by regressing `delta_S` on `S_{t-1}` (AR(1) on the formation spread) and reading off the mean-reversion coefficient.

A finite, positive HL is the necessary condition for a Z-score strategy to have any statistical edge. If `HL = infinity` (random walk), the spread has no tendency to revert and the signal is noise.

| Pair | Half-life (bars) | Half-life (approx. trading days) |
|------|----------------:|----------------------------------:|
| CMS / DUK | 679.7 | 1.74 days |
| DOW / LYB | 777.8 | 1.99 days |

Both pairs revert on a ~2-day timescale at 1-minute resolution, which is a realistic pairs-trading regime.

### 4.3 Hurst exponent (formation period)

The Hurst exponent H tests whether the formation spread is mean-reverting (H < 0.5), random-walk (H = 0.5), or trending (H > 0.5). It is estimated via the variance-ratio method (log-log regression of `std(S[t+τ] − S[t])` on lag τ).

| Pair | Hurst (formation) | Interpretation |
|------|:-----------------:|----------------|
| CMS / DUK | 0.452 | Mean-reverting |
| DOW / LYB | 0.483 | Borderline mean-reverting |

Hurst is a supporting diagnostic, not a primary test — it does not produce a p-value and classical R/S estimation has upward bias on financial data (~0.62 for true H=0.5). DOW/LYB's H=0.483 is statistically close to 0.5 and should be interpreted alongside the EG t-stat (-4.86, p=0.00029) rather than in isolation.

### 4.4 Rolling window selection

The rolling window for the Z-score mean and standard deviation is derived from the formation half-life:

```
window = clip(round(HL), min=10, max=2000)
```

The cap was raised from 240 to **2000 bars** after grader review identified the original 240-bar cap as the primary source of Z-score bias (see Section 6.1). At the new cap, the window now equals the half-life for the primary and secondary pairs:

| Pair | Half-life | Raw window | Clamped window | Change from v1 |
|------|----------:|-----------:|:--------------:|:--------------:|
| CMS / DUK | 679.7 | 680 | **680** | was 240 |
| DOW / LYB | 777.8 | 778 | **778** | was 240 |

**What the window represents:** 680 bars = 680 minutes ≈ 11.3 hours ≈ 1.74 trading days (matching the pair's half-life). 240 bars = 240 minutes ≈ 4 hours (roughly 60% of the 390-minute NYSE session) — the old cap covered only 35% of the reversion cycle.

---

## 5. Z-Score Signal Engine

### 5.1 Rolling Z-score construction

```
rolling_mean(t) = mean(S[t-window+1 : t])
rolling_std(t)  = std(S[t-window+1 : t],  ddof=1)
zscore(t)       = (S(t) - rolling_mean(t)) / rolling_std(t)
```

`ddof=1` (Bessel's correction) is used throughout. A small epsilon guard (`1e-10`) prevents division by zero during market halts or flat periods.

**Burn-in:** The first `window // 2` bars (340 bars ≈ 5.7 hours with window=680) of the trading period have NaN Z-scores because the rolling window is not yet full. These bars have `position = 0` (flat) and `signal_valid = False`. Week 3 PnL computation must gate on `signal_valid` rather than calling `.dropna()`, which would silently misalign indices.

### 5.2 Session open warmup

Overnight price gaps cause the first bars of each trading session to have a spread that jumps relative to the prior session's rolling statistics. This produces artificial Z-score extremes at the 09:30 open, triggering entries that are driven by the gap rather than genuine mean-reversion.

**Fix:** The first 30 bars (30 minutes) of each calendar session have their Z-score suppressed to NaN. The state machine holds its current position (flat at open) during this warmup. This is applied daily throughout the trading period, not just on day one.

```
session_open_warmup: 30  # bars per session open
```

Effect on CMS/DUK: reduces trading-period trade count from 111 (no warmup) to 90 (with 30-bar warmup) — approximately 19% of entries were gap-driven open-bar signals.

### 5.3 State machine

The position is generated by a path-dependent rule:

```
if position == 0:
    if zscore > +entry_z:  enter short  (spread is too high; expect reversion down)
    if zscore < -entry_z:  enter long   (spread is too low; expect reversion up)
if position != 0:
    if zscore crosses zero: exit to flat
```

Key properties:
- **No re-entry without zero-crossing:** prevents getting whipsawed inside a single excursion
- **NaN-safe:** a NaN Z-score holds the current position (does not trigger an exit) — applies during burn-in and session warmup
- **Stateless input/output:** vectorized via Numba `@njit(cache=True)` for O(n) throughput on 48k bars

The state machine uses `fastmath=False`. `fastmath=True` enables LLVM `nnan` semantics, causing `np.isnan()` to return False for actual NaN values, which would produce incorrect entries on NaN bars.

### 5.4 Execution lag

The position decided at bar t's close is not executable until bar t+1's open (or close, for an end-of-bar fill model). To reflect this:

```python
position_executed[t] = position[t-1]
```

`position_executed` is the column used for PnL in Week 3. Using `position[t]` instead would introduce a 1-bar lookahead on every single trade.

## 6. Entry Threshold: Why 2.0 and Not 1.5

### 6.1 Window-truncation bias (partially resolved)

When the rolling window is shorter than the half-life, the rolling standard deviation systematically understates the true spread standard deviation. The 240-bar cap (original design) covered only 35% of CMS/DUK's half-life — the rolling mean tracked current price levels rather than the long-run equilibrium, and the rolling std captured only local noise.

Raising the window cap to 2000 (window now = HL for the primary pairs) substantially reduces but does not eliminate the bias, because the half-life is a characteristic timescale, not an exact window choice:

| Pair | Window (v1) | Window (v2) | Z-score std (v1) | Z-score std (v2) | Improvement |
|------|:-----------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|:-----------:|
| CMS / DUK | 240 | 680 | 1.3928 | 1.3422 | -0.05 |
| DOW / LYB | 240 | 778 | 1.4170 | 1.4196 | ~0 |

The remaining inflation (std > 1.0) exists because even at window = HL, the spread is autocorrelated within that window — successive bars within one half-life period have not yet reverted. Setting window = 2×HL would reduce it further but at the cost of stale lookbacks on a 390-minute session.

### 6.2 Threshold sensitivity table

The pipeline now prints a formal threshold comparison on the formation-period Z-score for each pair, showing trade count, average hold duration, and total cost at 60 bps per round-trip (4 one-way legs × 15 bps each):

**CMS/DUK (formation period, window=680):**

| Entry Z | Trades | Avg hold (bars) | Total cost (bps) | Label |
|--------:|-------:|----------------:|-----------------:|-------|
| 1.5 | 124 | 273 | 7,440 | Too low |
| 2.0 | 88 | 316 | 5,280 | Fixed threshold |
| 2.5 | 66 | 331 | 3,960 | |
| 2.57 | 62 | 329 | 3,720 | Adaptive (95th pct \|Z\|) |

**DOW/LYB (formation period, window=778):**

| Entry Z | Trades | Avg hold (bars) | Total cost (bps) | Label |
|--------:|-------:|----------------:|-----------------:|-------|
| 1.5 | 92 | 367 | 5,520 | Too low |
| 2.0 | 74 | 385 | 4,440 | Fixed threshold |
| 2.5 | 52 | 426 | 3,120 | |
| 2.59 | 47 | 450 | 2,820 | Adaptive (95th pct \|Z\|) |

### 6.3 Why 2.0 is the correct fixed threshold

With the corrected window (680 bars), the empirical Z-score std is 1.34 for CMS/DUK. A Z=2.0 entry corresponds to 2.0 / 1.34 ≈ **1.49 true sigma** — significantly better than the 1.44σ under the old 240-bar window.

**At 1.5:** Entry occurs at 1.5 / 1.34 = 1.12 true sigma — barely outside one standard deviation. Entries at this level are dominated by noise. The formation period shows 124 trades (41% more than Z=2.0) for no improvement in signal selectivity. Total round-trip cost is 41% higher.

**At 2.0:** Selects the outer portion of the empirical distribution (approximately 13% of bars). Average hold of 316 bars ≈ 5.3 hours is consistent with the 1.74-day (680-bar) reversion timescale — trades enter at genuine divergences and hold through reversion. Cost at 5,280 bps total is meaningful but tractable.

**At adaptive (2.57):** Corresponds to the 95th percentile of |Z| on the formation period — the statistically rigorous equivalent of a true 2-sigma event given the window-truncation artifact. Produces 62 trades (30% fewer than Z=2.0) at 3,720 bps total cost. This is the correct threshold for a risk-conscious implementation. The case for 2.0 over adaptive is purely operational: the adaptive threshold is sensitive to formation-period anomalies and shifts between periods; the fixed threshold is predictable and comparable across pairs.

**Conclusion:** 1.5 is too low, generating noise entries with 41% more cost. 2.0 is the appropriate conservative fixed threshold. The adaptive threshold (2.57–2.59) is the statistically rigorous upgrade and should be used in the live implementation.

## 7. Results — Static OLS

### 7.1 Primary pair: CMS / DUK

| Metric | Value (v1: window=240) | Value (v2: window=680) |
|--------|:----------------------:|:----------------------:|
| OLS alpha | -0.6956 | -0.6956 |
| OLS beta | 1.0487 | 1.0487 |
| Formation half-life | 679.7 bars | 679.7 bars |
| Rolling window | 240 bars | **680 bars** |
| Z-score std (trading) | 1.3928 | **1.3422** |
| Adaptive threshold | 2.568 | **2.569** |
| Coverage gap ±2σ | +9.40 pp | **+8.34 pp** |
| Excess kurtosis | 0.057 | **-0.146** |
| Regime shift (cross-val drift) | 0.0275 | **0.059** |
| Trades (fixed Z=2.0, no warmup) | 265 | **111** |
| Trades (fixed Z=2.0, with 30-bar warmup) | — | **90** |
| Trades (adaptive Z, no warmup) | 184 | **66** |
| % Rolling windows H < 0.5 | 100% | 100% |

**Interpretation:** Raising the window from 240 to 680 bars has the expected effect: trades drop from 265 to 90 (with session warmup), z_std improves from 1.39 to 1.34, and coverage gap narrows from +9.4 to +8.3 pp. The excess kurtosis went slightly negative (-0.15) — the distribution is now marginally platykurtic, which is consistent with fewer spurious entries. 90 trades at 0.71/day is appropriate for a pair with a 1.74-day reversion timescale.

### 7.2 Secondary pair: DOW / LYB

| Metric | Value (v1: window=240) | Value (v2: window=778) |
|--------|:----------------------:|:----------------------:|
| OLS alpha | -0.8770 | -0.8770 |
| OLS beta | 1.0828 | 1.0828 |
| Formation half-life | 777.8 bars | 777.8 bars |
| Rolling window | 240 bars | **778 bars** |
| Z-score std (trading) | 1.4170 | **1.4196** |
| Adaptive threshold | 2.694 | **2.588** |
| Coverage gap ±2σ | +9.25 pp | **+7.89 pp** |
| Trades (fixed Z=2.0, with warmup) | 267 | **72** |
| Trades (adaptive Z, with warmup) | 175 | **61** |
| % Rolling windows H < 0.5 | 100% | 100% |

**DOW/LYB z_std anomaly — why the window fix had no effect.** Z-score std barely changed (1.417 → 1.420) when the window was raised from 240 to 778 bars, whereas CMS/DUK improved from 1.393 to 1.342. Two compounding factors explain this.

*Autocorrelation at the window lag.* Window-truncation bias is proportional to the spread's autocorrelation at the window-length lag: a more autocorrelated spread at lag L means the rolling std is a poorer estimator of true variance, and expanding the window helps more. Measuring the formation spread autocorrelation at the respective window lags: CMS/DUK has AC(lag=680) = 0.725, while DOW/LYB has AC(lag=778) = 0.583. DOW/LYB's spread is meaningfully less persistent at its own window length — the rolling std was already a less biased estimator even at window=240, leaving less room for improvement.

*OLS direction asymmetry.* As documented in Section 3.2, the DOW/LYB beta has an 8.8% asymmetry gap (vs 5.7% for CMS/DUK). A beta mis-stated by ~0.095 adds `0.095 × log(LYB_t)` as structural noise to every spread observation. This asymmetry-induced noise inflates spread variance independently of the rolling window length, creating a floor on z_std that window expansion cannot reach. CMS/DUK's 5.7% asymmetry produces a smaller floor, so the window fix provides more visible improvement.

The coverage gap did improve (+7.89 vs +9.25) because better window alignment reduces the tail-truncation artifact even when z_std is unchanged. The DOW/LYB z_std anomaly is not a signal of a broken pair — the EG t-stat (-4.86) and 100% mean-reverting windows confirm structural cointegration — but it does mean the Z=2.0 threshold is slightly more conservative for DOW/LYB than for CMS/DUK in terms of true sigma (2.0 / 1.420 ≈ 1.41σ vs 2.0 / 1.342 ≈ 1.49σ for CMS/DUK).

*\* 2000-bar cap applied (HL exceeds cap)*

**Key observations:**

**EG evidence is clean:** 9 trading pairs have EG t-stats in the -4.2 to -5.7 range — strong individual cointegration evidence. The 2 negative controls have t-stats near zero and p-values of 0.99. The formal test aligns exactly with the intuitive pair quality ranking.

**Window fix effect:** Trade counts dropped sharply for all pairs with HL > 240 (formerly capped pairs). AVGO/GLD: 206 → 26. LOW/MS: 227 → 27. DHI/LVS: 244 → 30. These were generating spurious entries on noise with the short window. Now they generate very few entries — the question for Week 3 is whether those few entries are genuinely profitable.

**Coverage gap narrowed but persists:** Even with window = HL, the gap remains +7–10 pp for most pairs. This is expected — the gap closes only when window >> HL (like GOOG/GOOGL at window=20, HL=19.6). For pairs with long half-lives hitting the 2000-bar cap (AVGO/GLD, LOW/MS, DHI/LVS, INTC/JPM), some truncation remains.

**Negative controls still generate signals:** CVNA/ISRG (28 trades) and INTC/JPM (27 trades) still produce entries. The EG test correctly identifies them as non-cointegrated, but long half-lives + some mean-reversion in rolling windows means the engine finds sporadic entries. A pre-filter requiring EG p < 0.01 would exclude these.

## 8. Dynamic Hedge Ratio — Kalman Filter Analysis

### 8.1 Motivation

The OLS beta is estimated once on Jan–Jun and frozen for Jul–Dec. If the true economic relationship between the two stocks shifts during the trading period, the frozen beta introduces phantom signal: the spread absorbs structural drift as if it were temporary mean-reversion, generating entries that will not revert.

For CMS/DUK in 2022, this is a legitimate concern. U.S. utilities experienced significant sector rotation during the energy price shock driven by the Ukraine conflict. A hedge ratio that was valid in Jan–Jun may not reflect the Jul–Dec relationship.

### 8.2 State-space model

The Kalman filter models the hedge ratio as a latent state following a random walk:

```
State:        theta_t = [alpha_t, beta_t]
Transition:   theta_t = theta_{t-1} + w_t,   w_t ~ N(0, Q)
Observation:  log(A_t) = [1, log(B_t)] @ theta_t + v_t,   v_t ~ N(0, R)
```

Parameters:
- `Q = (delta / (1 - delta)) * I₂` — process noise (controls adaptation speed)
- `R` — observation noise variance, estimated from OLS residuals on the first 500 bars only
- `delta = 1e-5` — default; beta half-life ≈ 180 trading days (weekly-regime adaptation)
- Initial state: `theta_0 = [0.0, 1.0]` (neutral: zero intercept, unit beta)

The filter is run on the **full year** (Jan–Dec). Formation data warms it up; trading data continues updating from the same state. There is no re-initialization at the formation/trading boundary — this preserves the causal guarantee: by July, the filter has absorbed 6 months of price history.

### 8.3 Beta drift finding

| Metric | Value |
|--------|------:|
| Static OLS beta (Jan–Jun) | 1.0487 |
| Kalman beta at formation end (Jun) | 0.7629 |
| Kalman beta at year end (Dec) | 0.7819 |
| Total drift vs OLS | -0.2668 (-25.5%) |
| R (observation noise) | 9.51 × 10⁻⁶ |
| Innovations std | 0.001613 |

The Kalman filter converged to a beta of ~0.78 — 26% below the OLS estimate of 1.05. This is a material structural finding: the CMS/DUK hedge ratio changed significantly in 2022. The static OLS strategy was computing spreads using a beta that was too large by roughly 0.27 throughout the trading period, adding structural drift to the spread as phantom mean-reversion signal.

### 8.4 Why the Kalman spread is not directly tradeable

When the Kalman Z-score is computed using the posterior state theta_t (state after observing bar t), the resulting spread is approximately the scaled Kalman innovation — white noise by construction, because the posterior fit removes the autocorrelation structure that pairs trading relies on. Formation HL ≈ 0.6 bars, Hurst ≈ 0 — these are artefacts of the posterior spread, not properties of the pair.

**Resolution (Option A):** The Kalman window is anchored to the OLS formation window (same 680-bar window as the static path). This makes the two methods comparable on the same timescale.

| Metric | Static OLS | Kalman (Option A) | Change |
|--------|:----------:|:-----------------:|:------:|
| Window (bars) | 680 | 680 (OLS anchor) | — |
| Z-score std | 1.3422 | 1.0550 | -0.29 |
| Excess kurtosis | -0.146 | 13.49 | +13.64 |
| Coverage gap ±2σ | +8.34% | +0.43% | -7.91 pp |
| Trades (fixed 2.0) | 111 | 1,814 | +1,703 |
| % Rolling windows H < 0.5 | 100% | 100% | 0 |

Z-score std improves to 1.055 and coverage gap nearly closes. However, kurtosis jumps to 13.49 and trade count is 1,814. The Kalman spread oscillates rapidly around zero even with the 680-bar window, producing many crossings with fat tails from occasional sudden beta jumps.

### 8.5 Practical use of the Kalman result

The beta drift plot (saved to `outputs/figures/kalman_beta_CMS_DUK.png`) is the most actionable output. A 26% drift in hedge ratio over one year is a warning that the static OLS position sizing is structurally misspecified from the first bar of trading. The correct response in a live system:

1. Use static OLS Z-score for **entry/exit signal timing** (retains the mean-reversion timescale)
2. Use Kalman beta for **position sizing and hedge ratio** (correctly sized exposure given current beta)
3. **Rebalance hedge ratio monthly or quarterly** — enough to capture structural drift without fitting noise

## 9. Flags and Known Limitations

### FLAG 1 — Window-truncation bias is reduced but not eliminated

Raising the cap from 240 to 2000 bars brought CMS/DUK and DOW/LYB to window = HL. Z-score std improved from ~1.39 to ~1.34 for CMS/DUK. Four pairs with HL > 2000 bars (AVGO/GLD, LOW/MS, DHI/LVS, INTC/JPM) still hit the cap. The residual inflation for all pairs is mechanically irreducible with a fixed rolling window — it converges to zero only when window >> HL, which is impractical at 1-minute frequency with 390-bar sessions.

**Status:** Partially resolved. Entry threshold argument adjusted accordingly (see Section 6.3).

### FLAG 2 — Session open warmup suppresses 19% of entries

The 30-bar session warmup identifies and suppresses gap-driven false entries at the 09:30 open. For CMS/DUK, this reduces trading-period trades from 111 to 90. Whether these 21 entries were profitable or loss-making is a Week 3 question — the warmup is conservative and prioritizes signal quality over frequency.

### FLAG 3 — Kalman beta drift is material but not directly tradeable

The 26% beta drift on CMS/DUK means the OLS strategy runs with a structurally incorrect hedge ratio for the entire trading period. The Kalman approach (as implemented with Option A) is not directly substitutable as a trading signal due to the white-noise spread problem (1,814 trades, kurtosis 13.5). The beta drift is a risk factor and position-sizing input, not a signal generator.

**LTCM connection.** The 26% drift has a direct parallel to the LTCM convergence-trade failure mode: when an apparently mean-reverting relationship is in fact undergoing structural change, a spread-entry position is not a temporary divergence that will revert — it is a bet against a trend. With static OLS, every trading-period spread observation absorbs `0.27 × log(DUK_t)` as phantom mean-reversion signal throughout Jul–Dec. An OLS-based entry that triggers on a Z=2.0 excursion is partially entering on genuine transient reversion and partially entering on structural drift that will not close. Without an explicit stop-loss or a dynamic beta update, the position can remain open and diverge indefinitely. This is precisely the mechanism that amplified LTCM's losses: models calibrated on historical co-movement relationships generated entries on pairs that had structurally decoupled, with no mechanism to distinguish structural from transient deviation.

### FLAG 4 — EG evidence is individual, not portfolio-level

The EG test statistics are strong for each pair individually. The BH-corrected p-values do not reject at the portfolio level — this is expected for a 32,000-pair universe scan. In a portfolio context, co-movement of pairs within the same sector (utilities, chemicals) means position sizing should account for cross-pair correlation.

### FLAG 5 — Weak alternatives should be excluded from live trading

AVGO/GLD (32% MR windows) and DHI/LVS (42% MR windows) show insufficient mean-reversion persistence in the trading period. With the corrected window, both generate only 26–30 trades — too few to assess statistical edge. They should be excluded pending further out-of-sample evidence.

### FLAG 6 — No transaction cost model

All trade counts are gross, before transaction costs. At 0.71 trades/day (CMS/DUK, Z=2.0 with warmup), a round-trip cost of 60 bps (4 legs × 15 bps) produces 0.71 × 60 = 42.6 bps/day of break-even requirement. Whether the average trade generates this in gross spread PnL is a Week 3 question. The adaptive threshold (Z=2.57, 66 trades with no warmup) reduces cost by 40% at the expense of fewer entries.

## 10. Conclusion

### What changed from v1 (grade-review response)

| Item | Before | After |
|------|--------|-------|
| Window cap | 240 bars | 2000 bars |
| CMS/DUK window | 240 bars | 680 bars (= HL) |
| CMS/DUK z_std | 1.3928 | 1.3422 |
| CMS/DUK trades (Z=2.0) | 265 | 90 (with warmup) |
| Cointegration evidence | Not cited | EG t-stats from Week 1 scan surfaced |
| Session open warmup | Not implemented | 30-bar suppression per session |
| Threshold table | Adaptive Z computed but unused | Formal sensitivity table printed for each pair |
| 240-bar time interpretation | "38 minutes" (wrong) | "4 hours / 60% of NYSE session" (correct) |

### What works

The static OLS Z-score engine correctly identifies and quantifies mean-reversion in CMS/DUK and DOW/LYB. Both pairs show:
- Strong EG cointegration evidence (t < -4.8, p < 0.0003) from the Week 1 scan
- Hurst < 0.5 on formation (mean-reverting confirmed as supporting diagnostic)
- 100% of rolling trading windows with H < 0.5 (regime persistence confirmed)
- No kurtosis excess above 3.0 (spread distribution is not genuinely fat-tailed after window fix)
- No regime shift detected (cross-validated drift < 0.5)
- 90 trades at 0.71/day — disciplined frequency consistent with a 1.74-day reversion timescale

### Why 2.0 and not 1.5 (final)

With window = HL (680 bars), Z=2.0 corresponds to ~1.49 true sigma. Z=1.5 corresponds to ~1.12 true sigma — noise-level entries with 41% more cost and no additional edge. The adaptive threshold (2.57) is the statistically rigorous choice (true 2-sigma given the window inflation), reducing cost by 30% and producing cleaner entries. Fixed Z=2.0 is retained as the operational default for cross-pair comparability; the adaptive threshold is recommended for the live implementation.

### What the Kalman filter tells us

A 26% structural drift in the CMS/DUK hedge ratio during 2022 (1.0487 → 0.7819) confirms the static OLS strategy was structurally mishedged throughout the trading period. The Kalman beta is the correct input for position sizing. The OLS Z-score remains the correct input for entry/exit timing. The two should be used together, not as alternatives.
