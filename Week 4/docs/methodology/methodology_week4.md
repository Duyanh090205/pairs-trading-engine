## Phase 1: Cointegration Thesis

### 1. Data Description & Preparation
**Architectural Segregation (EDA vs. Execution):** A core design principle of this pipeline is the strict isolation of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) from the execution engine. Data profiling and assumption validation are conducted in isolated scratchpad environments (e.g., `01_data_profiling.ipynb`). Only after assumptions are mathematically validated is the data passed to the main execution loops.

The foundation of the cointegration thesis relies on a rigorous data pipeline to ensure all statistical tests are performed on a clean, aligned, and log-transformed panel. The raw data consists of 1-minute OHLCV (Open-High-Low-Close-Volume) equity prices. 

**Data Range & Scope:**
- **Timeframe:** The full dataset spans from **January 3, 2022, to March 19, 2026**.
- **Market Regimes:** This timeframe naturally splits into two distinct regimes: the 2022 Bear Market (used as our initial testing ground) and the 2023-2026 Bull Market (used for out-of-sample generalization).

**Data Engineering & Quality Controls:**
1. **Timestamp Normalization:** Raw timestamps (stored as nanosecond UTC integers) are converted to UTC datetime and strictly localized to Eastern Time (`US/Eastern`) to accurately handle daylight saving transitions.
2. **Session Filtering:** Only data between **09:35 ET and 15:55 ET** is retained. The first and last 5 minutes of the trading day are discarded to remove artificial price volatility caused by market opening and closing auctions.
3. **Resampling:** To reduce microstructure noise (e.g., bid-ask bounce and stale quotes), the 1-minute bars are resampled into **5-minute bars** using the last observation in each window (`resample('5min').last()`).
4. **Log Transformation:** All closing prices are converted to natural logarithms ($L_t = \ln(P_t)$) to ensure scale invariance and proportionality in returns, which is fundamentally required for meaningful cointegration (measuring percentage co-movement rather than absolute dollar value).

**Universe Discovery & Screening:**
To build a tradable universe, all candidate tickers must pass strict survivorship and liquidity checks:
- **Continuous Rule:** A ticker must have continuous data without missing periods to avoid breaking the time series.
- **Hard Screens:** 
  - Median price $\geq$ $5.00 (eliminating penny stocks).
  - Average daily dollar volume $\geq$ $1,000,000 (ensuring execution liquidity and minimizing slippage).
  - Completeness $\geq$ 90% (ensuring dense data coverage).
  - Zero-return fraction < 50% (filtering out illiquid "zombie" quotes).
- **Universe Evaluation:** The strategy evaluates *all* possible unique pairs generated from the tickers that pass the hard liquidity screens, without applying an arbitrary cap, ensuring no viable opportunities are prematurely excluded.

**Outlier Treatment & Alignment:**
- **Z-Score Outlier Removal:** Minute-level returns with a Z-score > 10 are flagged as bad prints. These anomalies are replaced with `NaN` and forward-filled (limit = 1 bar). Tickers exceeding a 1.0% outlier threshold are completely dropped to protect the integrity of the statistical tests.
- **Strict Inner Join:** All individual 5-minute log-price series are merged using an inner join on the timestamp index. Any row containing a single `NaN` across any ticker is dropped. This produces a perfectly rectangular $T \times N$ matrix, ensuring that the downstream Engle-Granger OLS regression receives perfectly aligned data.

### 2. Statistical Validation & Cointegration Scan
The core cointegration scan evaluates all possible unique pairs generated from the screened universe to identify non-stationary price series that share a mean-reverting equilibrium. Our baseline methodology used the **Engle-Granger (EG) two-step procedure** combined with a strict filtering funnel. However, guided by critical peer reviews, our go-forward methodology incorporates significant mathematical upgrades to correct structural biases.

**Baseline Methodology (Week 1):**
1. **Engle-Granger Two-Step Test:**
   - **Step 1:** Run standard OLS regression ($A_t = \alpha + \beta \times B_t$) to find the hedge ratio ($\beta$) and extract the spread (residuals).
   - **Step 2:** Run an Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test on the spread to test for stationarity (mean-reversion), using `autolag='aic'` and MacKinnon critical values.
2. **The Three-Stage Filtering Funnel:**
   - **Programmatic Multiple-Testing Correction (BH-FDR):** Rather than merely identifying the multiple comparisons problem, the pipeline programmatically solves it by strictly applying the Benjamini-Hochberg False Discovery Rate at $q=0.05$. This rigorously controls false positives across thousands of pair evaluations.
   - **Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) Half-Life:** Required the mean-reversion half-life to be between **5 and 60 trading days** (avoiding microstructure noise and excessive capital lockup).
   - **Economic Logic Filter:** Required pairs to have a positive hedge ratio ($\beta > 0$) and a justifiable economic link (e.g., same GICS sector).

**Methodological Upgrades (Post-Review Architecture):**
The strictness of the baseline filters resulted in zero pairs surviving across a full year of 2022 data. Subsequent analysis and review identified structural limitations in the baseline approach, leading to three crucial methodology upgrades for the final strategy:

1. **Refining Hedge Ratio Calculations (Mitigating Attenuation Bias):**
   - *The Flaw:* Standard OLS minimizes variance only along the Y-axis. Because *both* price series in a pair contain noise, standard OLS suffers from attenuation bias, artificially depressing the estimated $\beta$.
   - *The Upgrade:* Moving forward, the hedge ratio calculation transitions to **Total Least Squares (TLS)**, **Orthogonal Distance Regression (ODR)**, or **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**. PCA, for instance, extracts the primary eigenvector of the combined price matrix, accounting for variance in both variables simultaneously and yielding a geometrically accurate, noise-adjusted beta.
2. **Upgrading to Symmetric Testing (The Johansen Procedure):**
   - *The Flaw:* The Engle-Granger test is fundamentally asymmetric (i.e., `coint(A, B)` yields a different p-value than `coint(B, A)`). While Week 1 attempted to fix this by testing both directions, doing so incorrectly doubles the multiple-testing penalty.
   - *The Upgrade:* The strategy now formally recognizes the **Johansen Cointegration Test** as the industry standard. The Johansen procedure is inherently multivariate and symmetric, bypassing directional bias entirely without inflating the BH-FDR penalty.
3. **Implementing Dynamic Hedge Ratios (Kalman Filter):**
   - *The Flaw:* Static OLS betas inherently drift over a full 12-month period due to shifting macroeconomic conditions. A fixed hedge ratio calculated in January will mis-hedge the portfolio by December, explaining why strict stationarity filters rejected all pairs over long horizons.
   - *The Upgrade:* To maintain cointegration through regime changes (from the 2022 Bear market into the 2023-2026 Bull market), the execution engine implements a **Rolling Kalman Filter**. This creates a *dynamic* hedge ratio that continually adapts to new data, substantially increasing the strategy's robustness in live environments.
4. **Calibrating OU Half-Life for Minute Bars:**
   - *The Flaw:* A half-life filter of [5, 60] trading days is suited for daily-close swing trading, but is vastly too slow for an intraday strategy operating on minute/5-minute bars.
   - *The Upgrade:* The OU half-life boundaries are formally recalibrated to **[0.5, 10] trading days**. This targets faster mean-reverting pairs suitable for the high-frequency nature of the execution timeframe, while still avoiding pure microstructure noise.
5. **Discarding the Subjective Economic Logic Filter:**
   - *The Flaw:* Requiring an explicit fundamental link (e.g., same GICS sector) arbitrarily penalizes pairs that share complex, latent macro exposures (e.g., statistical arbitrage across non-obvious correlated assets).
   - *The Upgrade:* The strategy transitions to a purely quantitative approach, discarding the manual economic logic filter. So long as the statistical robustness (Johansen, TLS, BH-FDR) holds, the algorithm is permitted to trade cross-sector pairs.

## Phase 2: Signal Logic & Execution Rules

### 1. Baseline Architecture (Week 2)
Following the identification of cointegrated pairs, the execution framework translates the statistical spread into a deployable trading signal. The baseline execution engine was architected around a state-dependent ruleset designed to prevent lookahead bias and handle intraday microstructure constraints.

**Data Architecture & Preprocessing (Phase 2 Distinctions):**
While Phase 1 (Cointegration Scan) and Phase 2 (Signal Execution) utilized the same underlying data repository, their engineering pipelines fundamentally differed to serve their respective objectives:
- **Session Boundaries:** Phase 1 truncated the session to 09:35–15:55 ET to mathematically isolate clean, noise-free bars for long-run cointegration testing. Conversely, the Phase 2 execution engine expanded the operating window to **09:30–15:59 ET**, capturing the full trading day to realistically model open and close market executions.
- **Data Granularity:** Phase 2 executed directly on raw **1-minute OHLC** bars (unlike the resampled 5-minute panel in Phase 1). This provided ultra-high resolution for intraday signal generation (generating ~96,770 total bars per pair annually).
- **Chronological Partitioning:** Phase 2 enforced a strict In-Sample / Out-of-Sample split (e.g., Jan-Jun for *Formation*, Jul-Dec for *Trading*). A programmatic guard (`ValueError if formation_end >= trading_start`) was implemented to categorically prevent data bleeding or lookahead bias between the parameter-fitting window and the live-execution window.

**Spread Construction & Z-Score Window:**
- **Spread Formula:** The spread was constructed using the static OLS hedge ratio calculated during the formation period: $S_t = \ln(A_t) - \alpha - \beta \times \ln(B_t)$.
- **Rolling Window & Half-Life Alignment:** The rolling mean and standard deviation for Z-score normalization utilized a dynamic window size explicitly set to equal the pair's Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) half-life. Following architectural review, the maximum window cap was raised from 240 bars to **2,000 bars** to ensure slower mean-reverting pairs were not prematurely truncated. A mandatory burn-in period of `window // 2` bars was required before generating the first signal.

**State Machine Architecture:**
- **Numba Compilation:** To circumvent the severe performance bottlenecks of iterating row-by-row in pandas, the core execution loop was written as a custom state machine compiled with Numba (`@njit(cache=True)`).
- **NaN-Safety & PnL Gating:** The engine strictly used `fastmath=False`. Enabling `fastmath` allows LLVM optimizations to evaluate `np.isnan()` as `False` for actual `NaN` values, which would catastrophically corrupt the state tracking. Furthermore, instead of dropping `NaN` rows (which misaligns temporal indices), a `signal_valid` boolean mask was used to gate downstream PnL calculations. If a `NaN` Z-score was encountered, the engine held the current state without triggering new orders.

**Entry and Exit Logic:**
- **Entry Threshold Selection:** The system initiated trades at **$Z = \pm 2.0$**. Specifically, entering a SHORT state when $Z > +2.0$ and a LONG state when $Z < -2.0$. Formal threshold analysis evaluated $Z=1.5$ (rejected due to 41% more noise trades) and adaptive $Z=2.57$ (rejected to maintain operational cross-pair comparability), solidifying $Z=2.0$ as the optimal baseline.
- **Exit Threshold:** Positions were exited (flattened to state `0`) upon a strict **zero-crossing** ($Z = 0$).
- **No Re-Entry Restriction:** To prevent compounding exposure on a continuously diverging spread, the state machine forbade re-entry. A spread had to explicitly cross zero and reset before a new trade could be triggered in the same direction.

**Position Sizing & Rebalancing:**
- **Version A (Static OLS):** Baseline sizing allocated capital using the static OLS $\beta$ calculated during the formation period.
- **Version B (Dynamic Kalman Filter Analysis):** As an alternative sizing model, a Rolling Kalman Filter (State-space model: $\theta_t = \theta_{t-1} + w_t$, with $\delta=1e-5$) was run to extract a dynamic $\beta$. Analysis revealed that static OLS $\beta$ severely drifted by **-25.5%** over the year (e.g., from $1.0487$ in Jan to $0.7819$ in Dec). While the Kalman spread itself was deemed non-tradeable (its kurtosis of 13.49 indicated it was essentially white noise by construction), the extracted Kalman $\beta$ was utilized purely to rebalance the position hedge ratio monthly, mitigating the structural mis-hedging of the static OLS approach.

**Microstructure Safeguards:**
- **Session Warmup:** The first 30 bars of every trading session were forced to `NaN`, suppressing false signals generated by chaotic opening auction volatility.
- **Strict Execution Lag:** Engineered absolute lookahead prevention by enforcing a one-bar execution lag (`position_executed[t] = position[t-1]`). A signal generated at bar $t$ could only execute at the closing price of bar $t$.

### 2. Methodological Upgrades (Post-Review Architecture)
The baseline engine proved highly performant but exhibited limitations in adaptability and validation rigidness. Guided by peer review, the following structural upgrades are implemented for the final production pipeline:

1. **Refining the Kalman Filter Spread (Prior vs. Posterior State):**
   - *The Flaw:* In the baseline (Version B), calculating the spread using the Kalman *posterior* state (after the current bar's observation is incorporated) forced the residual into pure white noise (Kurtosis 13.49, Half-life $\approx 0.6$). This rendered the spread un-tradeable, restricting Kalman's utility to only monthly position sizing.
   - *The Upgrade:* The execution engine is upgraded to compute the spread using the **Kalman prior state** (the statistical prediction *before* the new price is incorporated). This mathematical refinement yields a genuine out-of-sample residual that successfully retains tradeable autocorrelation, allowing the system to use dynamic Kalman Z-scores directly for entry/exit timing.
2. **Liquidity Profile Matching & Friction Calibration (Empirical Integration):**
   - *The Enhancement:* Integrating recent academic findings (Hussein, 2025), which demonstrate that trading volume is a dominant performance driver and that grouping stocks with similar liquidity characteristics yields significantly more stable cointegration relationships.
   - *The Upgrade:* The pipeline now enforces **Volume Symmetry**, requiring pair constituents to share matching liquidity profiles (e.g., average daily volume within the same order of magnitude). This minimizes asymmetric execution slippage (leg-in risk). Additionally, the robust 60 bps transaction cost model is mathematically defended by the finding that intraday commission fees and execution slippage impact high-frequency pairs trading significantly more than overnight borrowing costs.

## Phase 3: Verified Backtest Architecture (Week 3)

### 1. Baseline Verification & PnL Engine
To rigorously evaluate the signals generated in Phase 2, a custom-built, vectorized backtest engine was formalized in Week 3. The architecture prioritizes strict chronological integrity and institutional-grade performance metrics.

**Data Pipeline & Invariant Assertions:**
- **Pipeline Integrity:** The data ingestion pipeline concatenates raw CSVs, standardizes timezones to Eastern Time, and sorts by `(ticker, window_start)`. 
- **Strict Assertions:** Before any backtest executes, the data must pass three programmatic assertions: monotonic timestamps (no time-traveling), no duplicate rows, and valid OHLC structures (High $\ge$ Low).

**Execution Verification (Lookahead Prevention):**
- **Timestamp Verification Rule:** The engine programmatically asserts that the execution timestamp is strictly greater than the signal generation timestamp (`exec_ts > signal_ts`) for 100% of generated trades. This mathematical proof guarantees zero lookahead bias at the engine level.

**PnL Calculation & Mark-to-Market:**
- **Transaction Cost Friction:** The engine applied a formalized transaction cost model of **60 basis points round-trip**, split symmetrically into a 30 bps penalty at entry and a 30 bps penalty at exit.
- **Daily Mark-to-Market:** PnL is calculated using a daily Mark-to-Market methodology, accurately reflecting intraday equity fluctuations rather than just realized trade PnL.
- **Equity Curve Construction:** The portfolio equity curve is compounded daily: $Equity_d = Equity_{d-1} \times (1 + R_d)$, starting from a base of 1.0.

**Performance Metrics:**
- **Sharpe Ratio:** Annualized using daily granularity: $\text{Sharpe} = \frac{\mu(R_d)}{\sigma(R_d)} \times \sqrt{252}$.
- **Comprehensive Suite:** The engine outputs a comprehensive suite of institutional metrics including Maximum Drawdown (MaxDD), Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR), Calmar Ratio, and Win Rate.

**Negative Control Validation:**
- **Anti-Spurious Defense:** To prove the engine does not artificially manufacture returns from noise, non-cointegrated "Negative Control" pairs (e.g., CVNA/ISRG) are forced through the backtest. A successful engine audit requires these pairs to yield Sharpe ratios $\approx 0$ or negative, verifying that profitability stems exclusively from genuine cointegration (e.g., CMS/DUK), not systemic engine flaws.

**Automated Engine Diagnostics (Red Flag Triggers):**
To systematically prevent "too good to be true" results, the engine incorporates hard-coded diagnostic limits. If the baseline output violates predefined physical market boundaries, the backtest flags an architectural review. Key triggers include:
- **Lookahead Leak Flag:** If the baseline `Sharpe Ratio > 5.0`, the system alerts to a highly probable future-data leak (e.g., execution lag failure).
- **Discriminatory Edge Failure:** If the Negative Control's Sharpe ratio is within a $2\times$ gap of the Primary Cointegrated pair, the engine flags that the signal logic is failing to discriminate genuine mean-reversion from random walk noise.
- **Kalman Sizing Defect:** If the dynamically rebalanced Kalman sizing (Version B) underperforms the static OLS sizing (Version A), it triggers a mechanical audit of the rebalance timing logic.

**Comprehensive Audit Logging:**
- **Immutable Receipts:** Every backtest run generates a standardized, 7-section Verified Backtest Log (`.txt`). This artifact captures the complete execution state—including parameter hashes, a granular Trade Log sample, Comparative Analysis metrics, and the definitive Timestamp Verification proof—serving as a reproducible audit trail for the Investment Committee.
### 2. Methodological Upgrades (Proposed Architecture)
The baseline verification framework, while mathematically robust, relied on a static out-of-sample partition and fixed execution assumptions. To meet institutional standards for continuous model validation across shifting market environments, the following structural upgrades are currently proposed for future research:

1. **Implementing Rolling Walk-Forward Analysis (Status: Pending Research & Decision):**
   - *The Flaw:* A static single-split validation (e.g., Jan-Jun formation vs. Jul-Dec trading) is vulnerable to localized regime overfitting and does not realistically reflect continuous institutional model retraining.
   - *The Proposed Upgrade:* Transitioning the execution architecture to a **Rolling Walk-Forward Orchestrator**. The system would continuously roll through time (e.g., training on a 6-month window, trading on a 1-month window). While this increases out-of-sample rigorousness, the impact of transaction cost drag from frequent model rebalancing requires further empirical testing before final adoption.

2. **Dynamic Volatility-Adjusted Slippage:**
   - *The Flaw:* The baseline applied a rigid, static transaction cost of 60 bps. In reality, slippage is highly asymmetric and expands violently during high-volatility microstructure events.
   - *The Proposed Upgrade:* Upgrading the friction model to calculate slippage dynamically as a function of the asset's spread volatility and localized volume at the exact moment of execution. This yields a far more realistic simulation of institutional liquidity constraints.

3. **Execution Latency Parameterization (Decay Testing):**
   - *The Flaw:* The baseline successfully eliminated lookahead bias by enforcing a strict $t \to t+1$ execution lag, but implicitly assumed a perfect $1$-bar latency environment.
   - *The Proposed Upgrade:* Parameterizing the latency architecture to actively stress-test the strategy's alpha decay curve. By testing 2-bar, 5-bar, and randomized execution delays, the framework will map exactly how the statistical edge deteriorates in sub-optimal liquidity environments.

4. **Regime-Detection Gateways (Hidden Markov Models):**
   - *The Flaw:* Baseline pairs trading blindly assumes mean-reversion forces are constantly active, failing catastrophically when structural market relationships break (such as the regime shift observed entering 2023).
   - *The Proposed Upgrade:* Integrating statistical regime-detection algorithms, specifically **Hidden Markov Models (HMM)**. This layer acts as a macro-gateway, dynamically adapting the state machine or programmatically halting trading entirely when the broader market transitions into a non-stationary or divergent regime.

5. **Standalone Data Quality Gateway:**
   - *The Enhancement:* To elevate engineering practices, pre-execution invariant assertions (monotonicity, OHLC logic) are abstracted out of the engine into an isolated, fully vectorized "Data Quality Gateway" script. This enforces a strict separation of concerns, ensuring corrupted data is structurally barred from loading into memory.

## Empirical Findings & Architectural Implications

The rigorous quantitative development process across Phases 1-3 yielded several critical empirical findings. These practical realities directly expose the vulnerabilities of traditional statistical arbitrage and mandate the proposed methodological upgrades:

1. **The "Zero Pairs" Attrition Anomaly (Regime Fragility):** Out of 32,131 potential combinations across the S&P 500, exactly zero pairs survived the strict baseline filter (Engle-Granger + BH-FDR + 5-60d half-life) over the full 12-month 2022 dataset. *Practical Implication:* Traditional static cointegration is highly fragile to macro regime shifts. Strategies must incorporate dynamic elements to maintain an edge across multi-year horizons.
2. **Structural Hedge Ratio Drift:** The static OLS hedge ratio for the primary pair (CMS/DUK) drifted by **-25.5%** (from $\beta = 1.0487$ to $0.7819$) over a 12-month period. *Practical Implication:* Static position sizing guarantees structural mis-hedging in live environments. Continuous rolling or dynamic rebalancing is a mathematical necessity for long-term deployment.
3. **Kalman Posterior Untradeability:** Analyzing the Kalman posterior spread revealed an extreme Kurtosis of **13.49** (pure white noise). *Practical Implication:* While adaptive filters successfully track the dynamic mean, using the posterior state entirely destroys the tradeable signal. The execution engine must exclusively use the *prior* state residual to capture actionable autocorrelation and mean-reversion.
4. **Transaction Cost Dominance in High-Frequency Execution:** Moving the entry threshold from $Z=1.5$ to $Z=2.0$ reduced the total trade count for CMS/DUK from 124 to 88. This parameter tweak alone cut cumulative transaction costs by **2,160 bps** while increasing the true standard deviation capture from $1.12\sigma$ to $1.49\sigma$. *Practical Implication:* In high-frequency or intraday pairs trading, friction and slippage heavily dominate gross alpha. Optimizing thresholds to prioritize signal-to-noise ratio over trade volume is critical for net profitability.

**Strategic Synthesis & Next Steps:**
The preceding document synthesizes the transition from a highly rigid, localized baseline into an adaptive, institutional-grade framework. By meticulously documenting the mechanical limitations of the baseline and pairing them with mathematically sound upgrades (Johansen, Walk-Forward Orchestration, Dynamic Slippage, and HMM Regime Detection), this Whitepaper serves as the definitive architectural blueprint. These established principles will now form the foundation for formulating a comprehensive, newly updated execution plan that is concise, regime-aware, and logically flawless from end to end.
