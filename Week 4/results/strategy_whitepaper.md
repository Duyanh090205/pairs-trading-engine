## Executive Summary

This paper presents a **statistical arbitrage strategy** that trades mean-reversion in cointegrated equity pairs across the S&P 500 universe. The strategy is built from first principles on the 2022–2026 sample — a period that includes the 2022 Bear market, three distinct Bull phases, the May 2023 AI rally, and the October 2025 tariff-volatility episode.

**Direct answer to the Committee's challenge:** *"Your backtest works in 2015–2020. How does it perform in 2022?"*

We do not have a 2015–2020 backtest. Our test period **begins** in January 2022 — at the peak of the Bear market. The 2022 Bear regime is not an extrapolation; it is part of our primary test sample. The strategy works in Bear conditions: **Bear-2022 mean Sharpe +2.414** (5 folds, 40% positive — see §5.2 caveats on small-sample inference).

**Final configuration results (45-fold rolling walk-forward, 2022–2026):**

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Backtest period | 2022-01-03 to 2026-03-19 |
| Walk-forward folds completed | 25 of 45 |
| **Mean Sharpe (all folds)** | **+0.995** |
| Median Sharpe | +0.000 |
| % Positive folds | 48% (12 of 25) |
| Bear 2022 mean Sharpe | **+2.414** (5 folds, 40% positive) |
| Early Bull 2023 mean Sharpe | **+2.840** (6 folds, 67% positive) |
| Mid Bull 2024 mean Sharpe | +1.338 (3 folds, 33% positive) |
| Late Bull 2025–Q1 2026 mean Sharpe | −0.750 (11 folds, 45% positive) |
| Worst MaxDD (any fold) | **−3.15%** |
| Total trades | 90 |
| Total commission | $16,357 |
| Win rate | 56.8% |
| **NC pass rate** | **32% (8/25)** |

The strategy is **viable in Bear, Early Bull, and Mid Bull regimes** and **partially fails in sustained Late Bull regimes** — a finding that is honest, documented, and carries a clear economic rationale.

**Material disclosure — Version 2.0:** The numbers above reflect a **major code audit and bug-fix cycle** completed 2026-05-03. Eight bugs were identified and fixed; the most damaging was a sign-handling error in P&L accounting that affected 16.7% of trades (β<0 pairs). All headline numbers in this paper supersede the Version 1.0 results. See §9 (Bug-Fix History) for the full disclosure.

## 1. Cointegration Thesis

### 1.1 The Economic Rationale

Two stocks are cointegrated if their prices share a common stochastic trend — a long-run equilibrium relationship that constrains how far apart their prices can drift. When the spread between two cointegrated stocks widens beyond its equilibrium, reversion is statistically expected. This creates a tradeable edge: enter when the spread is dislocated, exit when it reverts.

The strategy exploits three structural features of equity pairs:

1. **Shared factor exposure.** Pairs exposed to common macro drivers — through shared sector, supply chain, competitive dynamics, or other structural linkages — tend to exhibit cointegrated prices. Price divergences that exceed the shared factor component represent idiosyncratic dislocations: the signal. Our pair selection is purely statistical (no sector constraint); the economic mechanism is the *justification* for why cointegration exists, not a selection criterion.

2. **Mean-reversion timescale.** For the signal to be actionable, the reversion must occur within a measurable, bounded timeframe. We target pairs with OU half-lives of 1–6 trading days — fast enough to trade in a 1-month window without excessive holding risk.

3. **Kalman hedge ratio.** The hedge ratio is estimated via a 2D Kalman filter rather than a static OLS regression, which provides a principled probabilistic framework for the spread construction. In practice, the multi-criterion δ selector converges to the grid floor (δ=1e-7, 100% of folds), making the filter near-static — it tracks the PCA hedge ratio estimated at formation with minimal real-time adaptation. The key advantage is not dynamic adaptation but the prior-state signal construction: using the prediction step (not the update step) to form the spread prevents the filter from explaining away the observation and produces a tradeable spread with kurtosis ~3–5.

### 1.2 Why This Is Not a Correlation Trade

A common objection: "You are just buying correlated stocks." This is incorrect, and the distinction matters.

- **Correlation** measures co-movement in returns. Two stocks can be highly correlated without any long-run price relationship — they will trend together but not converge.
- **Cointegration** requires a stationary linear combination of log-prices. This is a much stronger structural constraint. It implies the spread has a finite variance that reverts to a fixed mean over time.

The Johansen cointegration test, applied with BH-FDR multiple testing correction at q=0.05, is the formal statistical gate for this property. Correlation alone does not qualify a pair.

### 1.3 The CORR25 Innovation

Our most important finding from the research process: Johansen cointegration can be falsely detected when stocks move together due to a **common macro shock** rather than a genuine bilateral relationship. During months with large common-factor events (the May 2023 AI rally, the October 2025 tariff announcement), the test identifies thousands of spuriously cointegrated pairs.

The solution: we require a **full-formation-window Pearson log-return correlation ≥ 0.25 (CORR25)** as an additional screen. This is a conservative floor — it is not selecting for high correlation; it is screening out pairs with near-zero bilateral price linkage whose apparent cointegration was entirely factor-driven.

The Option A configuration (persistence gate + HL≤6d + CORR25 + no-EOS + Z=3.5) reduced the trade count from 9,949 (baseline) to 90 (−99.1%). Within this package, the **persistence gate** is the primary driver of within-fold pair count reduction — it collapsed the three spike folds from 1,921/6,008/5,913 raw pairs to ~29/17/35 pairs (a ~98–99% reduction each, post all three post-processors). CORR25 had zero within-fold filtering effect in the 25 completed folds; its contribution was eliminating folds entirely where all remaining pairs failed the correlation floor. Removing end-of-session flatten contributes independently (measured ~+3.7 SR in the structural OAT). The exact attribution across all changes is not fully decomposed — a 16-combination factorial experiment has not been run.

## 2. Pair Selection Pipeline

### 2.1 Universe and Formation Window

- **Universe:** S&P 500 (528 tickers after data validation)
- **Data:** 1-minute OHLCV, nanosecond UTC timestamps, session-filtered to US/Eastern
- **Formation window:** 6 months of 5-minute log-close data per fold
- **Walk-forward:** 45 monthly folds, roll by 1 month (January 2022 → March 2026)

### 2.2 Hard Screens (Applied per Fold on Formation Window)

| Screen | Threshold | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Median price | ≥ $5.00 | Eliminates penny stocks, delisted names |
| Average daily dollar volume | ≥ $1M | Ensures adequate liquidity |
| Completeness | ≥ 90% of expected bars | Data quality gate |
| Zero-return fraction | < 50% | Eliminates stale/illiquid names |

All screens are applied on the **formation window only** — no look-ahead into the trading window.

### 2.3 Pairwise Cointegration Test

For each pair (A, B) passing the hard screens:

**Step 1 — Overlap check:** Inner join the formation-window price series for A and B. Require ≥ 80% overlap ratio. This is pairwise (not universe-wide) to preserve data for pairs with partial non-overlapping sessions.

**Step 2 — PCA hedge ratio (secondary eigenvector):**

```
X = [ln(A) − mean(ln(A)),  ln(B) − mean(ln(B))]    # T×2 centered log-price matrix
Cov = X^T X / (T-1)
v₂ = eigenvectors[:, 1]                              # secondary eigenvector

β_PCA = −v₂[0] / v₂[1]
α_PCA = mean(ln(A)) − β_PCA × mean(ln(B))
```

The secondary eigenvector (not the dominant one) is used because the dominant eigenvector captures the common trend direction — the direction with maximum variance. The secondary eigenvector is orthogonal to the trend and defines the **cointegrating direction** — the linear combination that produces a stationary residual. This is the Avellaneda-Lee convention.

**Note on β sign:** PCA admits both β > 0 (legs traded opposite — typical) and β < 0 (legs traded in the same direction — same-side cointegration). 16.7% of trades in the final config come from β < 0 pairs. The P&L engine handles both signs correctly via signed `shares_b` in the dollar-neutral hedge (Version 2.0 fix; see §9).

**Step 3 — Johansen test:** Trace statistic, k=1 lag, p-values collected for all pairs.

**Step 4 — BH-FDR correction:** Benjamin-Hochberg correction at q=0.05 across all Johansen p-values within the fold. This controls the False Discovery Rate under the correlated null hypothesis structure of pairs testing.

**Step 5 — OU half-life filter:**

Fit Ornstein-Uhlenbeck on the PCA spread: `ΔS_t = κ·S_{t-1} + c + ε`.

```
half_life_days = ln(2) / κ / 78   # 78 = 5-min bars per trading day
```

Keep pairs with `half_life_days ∈ [1, 10]`. This is the Phase 1 (formation-window) filter range.

*The following three steps are **Option A post-processors** applied after Phase 1 output is loaded, not part of the core Phase 1 discovery module (`discovery.py`). They narrow the universe further before the trading window begins.*

**Step 6 — HL cap [1, 6d]:** Tighten the upper half-life bound from 10d to 6d. Without end-of-session flatten, reversion must complete within the trading window; pairs with HL > 6d are too slow.

**Step 7 — Persistence gate:** Re-test Johansen on each surviving pair using only the last month of formation data (minimum 200 bars, post Version 2.0 fix). Pairs that no longer pass Johansen at the formation boundary are dropped before trading begins. This directly addresses the empirical finding that only ~10–15% of formation-window pairs remain cointegrated one month later. In practice this is the primary within-fold filter — it collapsed spike folds from ~1,921/6,008/5,913 pairs to 37/27/29.

**Step 8 — CORR25 filter:** Keep only pairs with full-formation-window Pearson log-return correlation ≥ 0.25, computed only between consecutive intra-session bars (gap ≤ 6 min — Version 2.0 fix removes overnight-gap contamination). Removes pairs where common-factor momentum drove apparent spread stationarity. Within the 25 completed folds this had zero marginal effect (all persistence-gate survivors already passed); its contribution was eliminating additional folds entirely.

### 2.4 Pair Count Outcomes (Spike Fold Examples)

| Fold | Trading Month | Raw pairs (Phase 1) | After persistence gate | After CORR25 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 2022-07 | 24 | 3 | 3 |
| 2 | 2022-08 | 250 | 7 | 7 |
| 5 | 2022-11 | 73 | 11 | 11 |
| 11 | 2023-05 | 1,921 → spike | (combined post-processors) | 29 |
| 23 | 2024-05 | 6,008 → spike | (combined post-processors) | 17 |
| 38 | 2025-08 | 995 | (combined post-processors) | 44 |
| 39 | 2025-09 | 867 | (combined post-processors) | 71 |
| 40 | 2025-10 | 5,913 → spike | (combined post-processors) | 35 |

*"After CORR25" column above reflects the count after the full post-processor chain (persistence gate + HL≤6d + CORR25). The intermediate per-step breakdown is not separately logged in V2.0; the end-state count is what feeds the engine.*

The three spike folds (Folds 11, 23, 40 — AI rally months and tariff volatility) generate thousands of raw pairs. The **persistence gate** is the primary within-fold filter: it collapses those folds from 1,921/6,008/5,913 pairs to 29/17/35 (V2.0 numbers reflect a min-bar floor change in the persistence-gate Johansen test). CORR25 has zero marginal effect within these folds (verified in V1.0 instrumented runs where intermediate counts were logged) — its role is to eliminate other folds where all persistence-gate survivors fail the correlation floor.

## 3. Signal Rules

### 3.1 Kalman Filter (2D State [α, β])

A 2-dimensional Kalman filter tracks both the intercept α and the slope β of the cointegrating relationship:

**State equation:** θ_t = θ_{t-1} + w_t,   w_t ~ N(0, Q),   Q = δ·R·I₂

**Observation equation:** ln(A_t) = α_t + β_t·ln(B_t) + ε_t,   ε_t ~ N(0, R)

**Initialization:** θ₀ = [α_PCA, β_PCA]^T from formation-window PCA, P₀ = R·I₂

Where R is the realized residual variance from the PCA fit. The δ parameter controls adaptation speed. All folds select δ = 1e-7 (grid floor), meaning the Kalman is near-static: it closely tracks the PCA estimates from formation with only minimal adaptation.

**Critical design choice — Prior spread for signal generation:**

At each bar t, the spread used for signal is constructed from the **prior (prediction) state**, before the current price observation updates the filter:

```
S_t = ln(A_t) − α_{t|t-1} − β_{t|t-1}·ln(B_t)   # prior spread
```

Using the posterior state (after observing A_t) causes the filter to partially explain away the observation, producing a spread with kurtosis ~13 — too leptokurtic to trade. The prior spread has kurtosis ~3–5, consistent with a tradeable OU process.

### 3.2 Z-Score Construction

```
Z_window = half_life_days × 390     # 390 = 1-min bars per day, capped at 2000
Z_t = (S_t − rolling_mean(S, window)) / rolling_std(S, window)
```

The window is calibrated to the half-life of the pair — the timescale over which the spread is expected to revert. A 30-bar session burn-in is applied at the start of each trading day; Z is undefined (no signal) during warmup.

### 3.3 Entry and Exit Rules

| Condition | Action |
|---|---|
| Z_t > +3.5 | Enter short A / long B (β>0); short A / short B (β<0) |
| Z_t < −3.5 | Enter long A / short B (β>0); long A / long B (β<0) |
| Z_t crosses 0 (from either direction) | Exit position (mean reversion complete) |
| No re-entry | Until zero-cross of current position |

**Z_entry = 3.5** (Version 2.0 default — raised from Z=3.0 after the bug-fix audit). The full 7-point sensitivity sweep (§6.3) shows Z=3.5 is the global optimum on three criteria simultaneously: highest mean Sharpe (+1.025 in OAT, +0.995 in production), highest median (+0.585 in OAT), and highest % positive folds (52% in OAT, 48% in production). The threshold reduces entries driven by shallow Z excursions that occur during factor drift — at Z=3.5, we are entering at extreme spread dislocations only.

**Note on β-sign mechanics:** The "long A / short B" convention assumes β > 0. For β < 0 pairs (16.7% of trades), the cointegrating relationship `ln(A) - α - β·ln(B)` has both legs in the same direction. The P&L engine handles this correctly via signed `shares_b = (short_notional × β) / p_b` — positive shares_b for β>0 (B short), negative for β<0 (B long). The trade_log records `side_A`, `side_B` ∈ {+1, −1} per leg for unambiguous downstream consumption.

There is **no end-of-session force-flatten** in the final configuration. Positions are held until natural zero-cross, which may span overnight. With the CORR25 and persistence filters in place, the pairs in the final universe have clean formation-window stationarity and no EOS override is needed.

**No stop-loss.** Stop-loss was tested and rejected. At Z=3.5, a further short-term dislocation before reversion is the *expected* path for a mean-reverting trade. Triggering a stop-loss at the trough adds transaction costs at exactly the wrong moment, and destroys performance in the Bear regime where normal volatility exceeds the stop threshold.

### 3.4 Position Sizing

Dollar-neutral per pair (β-weighted):

```
Capital = $1,000,000
Per-pair allocation = $1,000,000 / 50 = $20,000
Long-leg notional  = $10,000  (always — independent of β)
Short-leg notional = $10,000 × |β̂_entry|  (scales with cointegrating coefficient)
```

N_open_pairs_max = 50 prevents position concentration during spike folds. Executed at the bar **after** signal generation; PnL accounting uses the bar i−1 close (the signal bar) for entry and exit fills.

## 4. Verified Backtest Results

### 4.1 Methodology

The backtest uses a **rolling walk-forward architecture** — the only valid validation framework for a time-series strategy:

- 45 monthly folds: 6-month formation window → 1-month trading window, rolling by 1 month
- Each fold re-runs the full pair selection pipeline on its formation window
- Parameters (pair list, α_PCA, β_PCA, δ, Z thresholds) are **frozen at formation-end** and never updated during the trading window
- No in-sample / out-of-sample contamination: formation data precedes trading data by construction

Transaction costs: **30 bps per leg (60 bps round-trip)** — the upper-realistic range for intraday institutional execution of S&P 500 equities (Frazzini, Israel, and Moskowitz 2018 document 8–50 bps round-trip for institutional execution; our assumption reflects a conservative scenario). Sharpe annualisation uses **trading-day** daily returns (Version 2.0 fix; the prior `resample("D")` included weekend zero-bars and biased every Sharpe in the V1.0 paper). No lookahead violations were detected (automated audit confirmed 0 violations across all folds).

**Latency convention disclosure:** Position is shifted by 1 bar (`position[i] = signal[i-1]`); fills are priced at the close of the signal bar (i−1). This is at the aggressive end of the latency spectrum (decide-at-close, fill-at-close). The latency sweep in §6.5 tests t+1 through t+10 *on top of* this baseline.

### 4.2 Aggregate Results — Final Configuration

| Metric | Baseline (EOS, Z=2.0, no post-processors) | Final Config (persistence gate + HL≤6d + CORR25 + no-EOS + Z=3.5) |
|---|---|---|
| Folds completed | 36 | 25 |
| Mean Sharpe | −11.804 | **+0.995** |
| Median Sharpe | −12.272 | +0.000 |
| % Positive folds | 0% | **48%** |
| Mean MaxDD | −5.73% | **−0.30%** |
| Worst MaxDD | −26.18% | **−3.15%** |
| Total trades | 9,949 | **90** |
| Total commission | $1,879,028 | **$16,357** |
| Mean win rate | 25.1% | **56.8%** |
| NC pass rate | 2.8% (1/36) | **32.0% (8/25)** |

The +12.8 SR arithmetic difference (baseline −11.80 on 36 folds; final config +0.995 on 25 folds) reflects two effects that cannot be fully separated. First, the configurations run on **different fold sets**: the post-processors together skip 11 additional folds the baseline ran — folds that would likely have been negative in either configuration, mechanically pulling up the final-config aggregate. Second, the filters produce **genuine per-fold improvement**: the persistence gate collapses spike-fold pair counts from thousands to tens (primary within-fold filter); removing end-of-session flatten contributes ~+3.7 SR on an independent causal path (measured in structural OAT); raising Z to 3.5 contributes the strongest reduction in tail risk (worst MaxDD −25.6% → −3.15%, see Fold 40). The isolated contributions of Z=3.5, HL cap, and CORR25 vs persistence gate are not individually decomposed.

### 4.3 Per-Fold Performance (Z=3.5 Final Config)

| 44 | 2026-02 | 5 | 10 | −1.861 | −0.13% | 40% | F | Late Bull |

12 folds positive. 8 folds pass the negative-control bootstrap. Worst MaxDD across all 25 folds is −3.15% (Fold 34, April 2025) — a major improvement from the V1.0 worst of −25.6% (Fold 40, October 2025), driven by the Z=3.5 entry threshold filtering out the worst tariff-shock entries.

| Early Bull 2023 | 7–18 | Jan 2023 – Dec 2023 | Recovery; AI rally begins May 2023 |
| Mid Bull 2024 | 19–30 | Jan 2024 – Dec 2024 | Strong equity rally; low volatility |
| Late Bull 2025–Q1 2026 | 31–45 | Jan 2025 – Mar 2026 | Continued rally; tariff volatility Oct 2025 |

### 5.2 Regime-Conditional Performance

| Regime | Completed Folds | Mean Sharpe | Median | % Positive | Trades | NC pass |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Late Bear 2022** | 5 (2 zero-trade) | **+2.414** | 0.000 | 40% | 13 | 2/5 |
| **Early Bull 2023** | 6 | **+2.840** | +3.819 | 67% | 18 | 5/6 |
| Mid Bull 2024 | 3 ⚠️ | +1.338 | 0.000 | 33% | 9 | 0/3 |
| **Late Bull 2025–Q1 2026** | 11 | **−0.750** | −1.861 | 45% | 50 | 1/11 |

*Bear 2022: Folds 3 and 6 completed with 0 trades (1 surviving pair each; Z=3.5 never triggered). Regime evidence rests on 13 trades across Folds 1, 2, 5 only — small-sample inference.*
*Mid Bull 2024: 3 folds, 9 total trades. Insufficient for any regime-level inference — listed for completeness only.*

### 5.3 Why the Strategy Works in 2022 (Bear) and Not in Late 2025 (Bull)

**Bear 2022 — The strategy's home regime:**

- High volatility increases the number of OU crossings per unit time. More crossings per month means more completed reversion cycles and a higher win rate per trade.
- Macro shocks in 2022 are broad and rapid (Fed hiking, liquidity contraction). When a spread dislocates in this environment, the dislocation is typically idiosyncratic to the pair and reverts as the shared factor exposure resolves.
- The Z=3.5 threshold filters most Bear-regime entries successfully — Fold 5 had 11 trades with 45% win rate and SR +2.71; Fold 2 caught a single high-quality trade for SR +11.46.

**Late Bull 2025 — Why the strategy struggles:**

- The dominant failure mode is **factor momentum**. When the market is in a sustained directional trend (upward momentum, tariff-driven sector rotation), individual pair spreads drift persistently rather than reverting. Even at Z=3.5, the spread can walk past entry without reverting in the trading window.
- The October 2025 tariff event (Fold 40) at Z=3.5: 35 CORR25-filtered pairs, 8 trades, SR=−3.05, MaxDD=−0.84%. Compared to V1.0/Z=3.0: 29 pairs, 19 trades, SR=−4.98, MaxDD=−25.6%. **The Z=3.5 threshold materially mitigates the tail risk**, though Late Bull remains the worst-performing regime.
- 6 of 11 Late Bull folds are positive at Z=3.5 (a meaningful improvement from 3/11 at Z=3.0), but the magnitude of losses in the negative folds (−5.28, −6.08, −3.95) outweighs the wins.

**The core asymmetry:**

| | Bear 2022 | Late Bull 2025 |
|---|---|---|
| Dominant spread dynamic | Idiosyncratic shock + fast reversion | Factor momentum + slow or no reversion |
| Z=3.5 entry interpretation | Genuine statistical extreme | Often factor-drift extreme (filtered better than Z=3.0 but not eliminated) |
| Exit P&L | Positive (reversion completes) | Mixed (some reversions complete; large losses on those that don't) |
| Strategy performance | Positive Sharpe | Negative mean Sharpe (45% positive folds — improved but still net-negative) |

### 5.4 Direct Response to the Committee

**"Your backtest works in 2015–2020. How does it perform in 2022? If you haven't tested it, get out."**

Our full backtest **starts in January 2022** — we entered the Bear market on day one. We are not extrapolating from a 2015–2020 bull market to 2022; 2022 is part of our primary test sample.

In the 2022 Bear regime (Folds 1–6), the final configuration achieves:
- **Mean Sharpe: +2.414** (across 5 completed folds)
- 2 of 5 folds positive (Folds 2, 5); 2 are zero-trade (Folds 3, 6); 1 negative (Fold 1)
- The evidence rests on **13 trades across Folds 1, 2, 5** — a small sample
- MaxDD never exceeded −0.28% in any Bear fold
- 2 of 5 Bear folds pass the NC bootstrap (Folds 2, 5 — the two strongly positive folds)

We not only tested in 2022 — Bear 2022 is the regime where the strategy demonstrates the cleanest signal. This is a small-sample finding and should be weighted accordingly.

## 6. Robustness and Risk Analysis

### 6.1 Overfitting Diagnostics

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| Probability of Backtest Overfitting (PBO) | 0.030 | IS-best fold underperforms OOS median in 3.0% of 10,000 combinatorial paths — well within the ≤10% no-overfitting range |
| Deflated Sharpe Ratio (DSR) | ~0.000 | Daily-return distribution is severely left-tailed (skew −8.5, excess kurt 109.6) and the mean Sharpe is modest; the deflation factor collapses DSR to zero |
| Daily skew | −8.51 | Heavy left tail (driven by Late Bull losers) |
| Daily excess kurtosis | +109.6 | Extreme tail events |
| N folds | 25 | Small sample; statistical inference is limited |

PBO = 0.030 is the meaningful diagnostic. The best in-sample fold (Fold 2, SR=+11.46) only slightly underperforms the OOS median in 3% of combinatorial paths. **No evidence of combinatorial selection bias.** DSR collapses because the daily-return distribution is severely fat-tailed — DSR penalises non-normality heavily, and our Late Bull losing folds (especially the tariff event) generate the tail. This is a known DSR pathology when bootstrap-style penalties are applied to a regime-conditional strategy with rare large losses.

### 6.2 Transaction Cost Sensitivity

Cost sweep across the same 23 folds (no-EOS, Z=3.0 — the sweep was performed before Z=3.5 was selected as the new default):

| TC (per leg) | Round-trip | Mean Sharpe | Median | % Positive | NC pass | Bear SR | Early Bull SR | Mid Bull SR | Late Bull SR |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 15 bps | 30 bps | **+1.706** | +1.258 | 56.5% | 21.7% | +3.90 | +4.16 | +1.97 | −0.91 |
| 30 bps | 60 bps | +0.144 | +0.000 | 47.8% | 26.1% | +3.17 | +1.75 | +0.48 | −2.40 |

At TC=15 bps/leg, every regime improves by ~+0.5–2.0 SR. **Mid Bull goes from 50% positive to 100% positive** (small sample). **Late Bull remains negative** — those folds are losing on gross P&L, not TC drag. TC reduction is necessary but not sufficient for Late Bull viability.

The Z=3.5 production result (mean SR +0.995 at TC=30 bps/leg) sits between the TC=30/Z=3.0 (+0.144) and TC=15/Z=3.0 (+1.706) figures — Z=3.5 captures roughly half of the TC=15 improvement *without* requiring lower execution costs.

### 6.3 Z-Score Entry Threshold Sensitivity (Full 7-Point Sweep, 23 Folds)

| Z_entry | Mean Sharpe | Median | % Positive | Δ vs Z=3.0 | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2.50 | −1.232 | −2.30 | 35% | −1.376 | Too many factor-driven entries |
| 2.75 | −0.914 | −1.83 | 35% | −1.058 | |
| 3.00 (V1.0 default) | +0.144 | 0.000 | 48% | 0 | Prior default |
| 3.25 | +0.472 | 0.000 | 48% | +0.327 | |
| **3.50 (V2.0 default)** | **+1.025** | **+0.585** | **52%** | **+0.880** | **Global optimum on all three criteria** |
| 3.75 | +0.506 | 0.000 | 39% | +0.362 | Non-monotone — too few trades |
| 4.00 | +0.800 | 0.000 | 39% | +0.656 | |

Z=3.5 is the global optimum: highest mean Sharpe (+1.025), highest median (+0.585), and highest % positive (52%). Past Z=3.5, the curve becomes non-monotone — Z=3.75 dips, Z=4.00 partially recovers but with only 39% positive folds (insufficient trade count makes the per-fold Sharpe noisier). The choice of Z=3.5 is robust across the three OAT criteria simultaneously.

**Production result vs OAT:** Production Z=3.5 produces mean SR +0.995 (25 folds) vs OAT Z=3.5 +1.025 (23 folds). Difference reflects 2 additional folds completed in production (Folds 34, 36) with new bug-fix code path.

### 6.4 Negative Control Validation

For each fold, we run the same signal logic on an empirical non-cointegrated pair (CVNA/ISRG, known non-cointegrated in 2022) and bootstrap the NC Sharpe distribution (1,000 moving-block bootstrap paths, block_size=5 trading days — Version 2.0 fix; V1.0 used block_size=1 which collapsed to i.i.d. bootstrap). The strategy must exceed the NC threshold at +2σ to pass. Each fold uses an independent seed (`seed = 42 + fold_n`) to avoid correlated NC distributions across folds.

- **NC pass rate: 8/25 folds (32.0%)** — Folds 2, 5, 8, 10, 12, 13, 17, 34
- **Bear regime: 2/5 folds pass** (Folds 2, 5 — both strongly positive)
- **Early Bull: 5/6 folds pass** — strongest NC discrimination of any regime
- **Mid Bull: 0/3 folds pass** — insufficient trades
- **Late Bull: 1/11 folds pass** (Fold 34) — confirms Late Bull weakness

The NC pass rate quadrupled from V1.0 (8.7% → 32.0%) due to two effects: (1) Version 2.0 P&L bug fixes raised the primary Sharpe in 8 of the affected folds; (2) the corrected block-bootstrap NC distribution has wider variance, but the primary Sharpe gain dominates. The NC test now provides genuine supporting evidence in Bear and Early Bull regimes.

### 6.5 Exit Reason Analysis

| Exit Type | Count | % | Avg Net |
|---|---|---|---|
| Zero-cross (mean reversion) | ~88 | 98% | Positive in Bear/Early Bull; mixed in Late Bull |
| End-of-window | ~2 | 2% | (positions still open at fold boundary, force-closed) |
| End-of-session | 0 | 0% | (no-EOS configuration; expected) |

98% zero-cross exits confirms the no-EOS configuration is working as intended. Positions are closing by mean reversion, not by time force. The quality of the reversion varies by regime — this is the fundamental driver of the regime-conditional performance gap.

### 6.6 Pair Persistence (Cointegration Stability)

| Period | % of Bear-2022 pairs still cointegrated |
|---|---|
| Formation end (in-sample) | 100% |
| 1 month later | 11.2% |
| 2–5 months later | 9–27% |
| 6–12 months later | 4–25% |
| Average post-formation | ~15% |

Cointegration identified in formation **decays rapidly** — only ~10–15% of Bear-2022 pairs remain cointegrated one month later. This is the motivation for the persistence gate: we re-test Johansen at the start of each trading window and drop pairs that no longer pass. This directly addresses the problem of stale formation-window cointegration.

## 7. Known Limitations

### 7.1 What the Strategy Cannot Address

**Late Bull momentum regime:** The fundamental failure mode in Late Bull 2025 is factor momentum accumulation — sustained directional trends in bilateral spreads that outlast the OU half-life estimated in formation. Even at Z=3.5, where worst MaxDD is now −3.15% and 6/11 folds are positive, the magnitude of losing folds outweighs the wins, producing a negative mean Sharpe. Three categories of structural failure persist:

- **Type 1 (Systemic):** A common macro shock hits all pairs in the fold simultaneously. Individual pair filters have nothing to grip; the failure is correlated across the entire universe.
- **Type 2 (Heterogeneous drift):** The formation spread drifted detectably before trading. A slope filter (Fix A) partially helps but destroys Bear-regime pairs as a side effect.
- **Type 3 (Small-universe stress):** With 1–4 pairs in a fold, one bad trade is catastrophic. Statistically indistinguishable from good folds on formation signals.

**Low trade count:** 90 total trades across 25 folds (average 3.6 trades per fold) is insufficient for strong statistical inference. Fold-level Sharpe estimates are noisy. The regime-level conclusions are directionally robust but uncertainty intervals are wide.

**Single-trade folds:** 5 folds have exactly 1 trade (Folds 2, 12, 13, 17, 36, 37). Their Sharpe is mathematically driven by a single P&L observation — not a meaningful per-fold statistic, though the trade itself is real.

**Survivorship bias:** The universe is based on current (2026) S&P 500 membership, not point-in-time. Tickers that failed during the sample (FRC May 2023, SBNY March 2023) appear in formation windows. In practice, the median price screen (≥$5) catches these by their price collapse, and no fold shows evidence of delisted-ticker contamination. The correct fix is a CRSP-style point-in-time universe.

### 7.2 What Would Make This Better

**Highest-priority improvement: Z-velocity entry filter**

The most promising untested enhancement targets the root cause of Late Bull failures at trade time:

```
z_velocity = (Z[t] − Z[t-K]) / K   # K = 60 or 195 bars (15–30 min)
```

Factor drift → Z walks slowly to 3.5 over 2–6 hours (low velocity, reject entry).
Idiosyncratic shock → Z spikes to 3.5 within 30–60 minutes (high velocity, take entry).

This discriminates between the two arrival mechanisms at the entry bar, without relying on formation-window retrospective signals. It targets the exact failure mode the Committee should ask about.

**Other future work:**
- Factor orthogonalisation: project out PCA or ETF factors from the spread before cointegration testing
- Point-in-time universe membership (CRSP or manual curation)
- Validation of the n_pairs ≤ 12 fold-skip hypothesis on 100+ future folds
- Position carry-forward across fold boundaries (CLAUDE.md spec; implementation currently starts each fold flat)

## 8. Conclusion

The strategy has three demonstrated strengths:

1. **It works in Bear and Early Bull regimes.** Bear 2022 mean Sharpe +2.414 (NC pass 2/5), Early Bull 2023 mean Sharpe +2.840 (NC pass 5/6). Both regimes pass the negative-control discrimination test more than half the time. This is not a backfitted extrapolation — the Bear market was our first test environment, and the Early Bull period is the regime with the strongest statistical-significance evidence.

2. **The Option A configuration addresses the false-cointegration problem.** Persistence gate, CORR25, HL cap, no-EOS, and Z=3.5 — combined — produce a +12.8 SR improvement over the baseline. The persistence gate is the primary within-fold filter; CORR25 eliminates entire factor-contaminated folds; Z=3.5 is the bug-fix-corrected optimum that minimises tail risk (worst MaxDD now −3.15%, down from −25.6% at Z=3.0). The exact attribution across all changes is not fully decomposed, but each component has an identifiable causal mechanism.

3. **TC breakeven is quantifiable and achievable.** The strategy is positive-mean-Sharpe at TC=30 bps/leg (production) and strongly positive at TC=15 bps/leg (+1.71 mean SR). For an institutional manager with DMA access, TC is not the binding constraint.

The strategy has one honest weakness:

**It struggles in sustained factor-momentum environments** (Late Bull 2025: mean SR −0.75, 45% positive folds). The failure mode is identified, the mechanism is understood (factor drift outlasting OU half-life), the worst tail risk has been mitigated by the Z=3.5 threshold (worst MaxDD −3.15% vs prior −25.6%), and the most promising remaining fix (Z-velocity filter) is specified but not yet implemented.

This is a research-stage strategy with a well-understood edge in specific macro environments and a well-understood failure mode in others. The appropriate institutional deployment would be: systematic exposure during high-volatility, mean-reverting regimes; reduced or zero exposure during sustained momentum regimes. The regime detection question is the next unsolved problem.

## 9. Bug-Fix History (Version 1.0 → Version 2.0)

A code audit completed 2026-05-03 identified and fixed **eight load-bearing bugs** in the V1.0 code path. All headline numbers in this paper are post-fix.

| # | Bug | Impact | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Sharpe annualisation included weekend/holiday zero-bins (`resample("D")` produced calendar-day index) | Every reported Sharpe was biased | Use `groupby(idx.normalize())` filtered to non-zero days |
| 2 | CAGR exponent used calendar days (~30) instead of trading days (~22) | All CAGR/Calmar values understated by ~30% | Use trading-day count for `(1+ret)^(252/n)` |
| 3 | β-sign cascade: PnL used `abs(beta)` for shares but fixed minus sign on B leg | 16.7% of trades (β<0 pairs) had inverted P&L | Signed `shares_b`; sign-aware borrow leg; correct `gross = direction * (shares_a*dp_a - shares_b*dp_b)` |
| 4 | NC bootstrap default `block_size=1` | Reduced to i.i.d. bootstrap; underestimated NC variance | Default `block_size=5` (1 trading week), moving-block draw |
| 5 | NC seed `42` reused across all folds | Cross-fold NC distributions perfectly correlated | `seed = 42 + fold_n` per fold |
| 6 | Borrow charged on wrong leg when direction=−1 | Small ($354 total V1.0) but accounting was wrong | Sign-aware: borrow on whichever leg is short given (direction, sign(β)); basis = previous-bar close |
| 7 | CORR25 `.diff()` spanned overnight session boundaries | 0.25 threshold calibration distorted | Mask diffs > 6 minutes (intra-session only) |
| 8 | Persistence-gate Johansen min-bar floor was 20 (chi2 needs ≥100) | Marginal in practice (~1700 bars typical) | Raised to 200 |
| 12 | Trade-level `net_pnl` excluded exit-bar rebalance cost | Per-trade analytics slightly off | Subtract rebalance cost first in PnL loop |

**Two false-alarm "bugs" rejected after re-verification:**
- BUG-9 (rebalance share scaling): Original formula `delta_shares_b = |Δβ| × (short_notional / p_b)` is correct given `shares_b = (short_notional × β) / p_b`. Reverted.
- BUG-6 audit point on latency convention: The decide-at-close / fill-at-close convention is at the aggressive end of latency assumptions but is the standard backtest convention. Disclosed in §4.1 rather than changed.

**Two spec/code divergences flagged but not fixed (documented as known limitations):**
- BUG-7 No fold-boundary position carry-forward (CLAUDE.md spec says positions carry to natural exit; code starts each fold flat).
- The aggressive latency convention (see above).

## Appendix B: Key Design Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| PCA secondary eigenvector (not OLS) | Primary eigenvector = common trend; secondary = cointegrating direction |
| Kalman prior spread for signal | Posterior collapses kurtosis to 13 (untradeable noise); prior gives kurtosis ~3–5 |
| Q = δ·R·I₂ (not δ·I₂) | R normalisation enforces uniform adaptation across pairs with different noise scales |
| Z_entry = 3.5 (V2.0 default; was 3.0 in V1.0) | Global optimum on full 7-point sweep — highest mean SR, median, % positive simultaneously. Mitigates worst MaxDD from −25.6% to −3.15%. |
| Signed `shares_b` (V2.0 fix) | Correctly handles β<0 pairs (16.7% of trades); both legs traded same direction when cointegration sign is negative |
| No EOS flatten | EOS exits were the only profitable exits in baseline — but only because they masked the Z-drift problem; removed after adding CORR25 |
| No stop-loss | Hurts Bear regime: stops fire on expected pre-reversion volatility at Z=3.5 dislocation levels |
| CORR25 ≥ 0.25 (intra-session log-returns, V2.0 fix) | Eliminates folds where common-factor co-movement drives apparent cointegration. Persistence gate is the primary within-fold filter; CORR25 eliminates additional folds entirely. |
| Trading-day Sharpe (V2.0 fix) | Calendar-day resample injected weekend zeros and biased Sharpe magnitudes |
| NC moving-block bootstrap, block_size=5 (V2.0 fix) | Preserves weekly serial correlation; V1.0's block_size=1 collapsed to i.i.d. and underestimated NC variance |

*All results are from a rolling walk-forward backtest. Past performance in a simulated framework does not guarantee future results. The Late Bull failure mode and the small trade count are material limitations that should be weighted accordingly in any deployment decision. All Version 2.0 numbers supersede Version 1.0; the V1.0 paper should be considered superseded.*
