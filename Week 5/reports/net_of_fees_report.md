# Net-of-Fees Performance Report — Week 5

## 1. Executive Summary

> **Correction notice, added 2026-09-10.** Two things on this page did not survive later
> checking. The verdict line calls the strategy a survivor of friction, while this same
> document reports DSR p = 0.000 against an E[max SR] threshold of 2.05 and a negative
> control passing in only 8 of 22 folds — that is a strategy failing its own significance
> screen, and the friction verdict should not be read without it. And the quote panel this
> cost model is calibrated on is not measured microstructure: it was constructed for the
> project from close prices plus a modelled spread series, with the deeper levels generated
> from L1. Week 6 later found the underlying edge to be an artifact of unbounded hedge
> ratios; see [`Week 6/documents/log.md`](../../Week%206/documents/log.md).


**Verdict (as originally written, and see the correction notice above):** Strategy survives
friction. Dynamic net Sharpe = 0.443. It does not survive the significance screen in §6 of this
same report, and Week 6 found the underlying edge to be an artifact.

- Trades evaluated: 90
- Mean dynamic RT cost: $90.57 (~45.3 bps of allocated capital)
- Sharpe (Gross): 0.503
- Sharpe (Static60bps): 0.365
- Sharpe (Dynamic): 0.443

## 2. Empirical Spread Profile

Per-tier intraday U-shape (from kill-zone Part A):

| bucket      |   Tier1_Tight |   Tier2_Medium |   Tier3_Wide |
|:------------|--------------:|---------------:|-------------:|
| 09:30-10:00 |         13.46 |          20.73 |        38.73 |
| 10:00-10:30 |          8.47 |          13.57 |        26.17 |
| 10:30-11:00 |          7.33 |          11.98 |        23.39 |
| 11:00-11:30 |          7.08 |          11.73 |        23.02 |
| 11:30-12:00 |          8.02 |          14.47 |        29.77 |
| 12:00-12:30 |          7.81 |          13.93 |        28.48 |
| 12:30-13:00 |          7.48 |          13.26 |        27.1  |
| 13:00-13:30 |          7.19 |          12.65 |        25.79 |
| 13:30-14:00 |          6.57 |          11.44 |        23.56 |
| 14:00-14:30 |          5.8  |          10.15 |        21.56 |
| 14:30-15:00 |          5.21 |           9.22 |        19.95 |
| 15:00-15:30 |          4.14 |           7.39 |        17.16 |
| 15:30-15:59 |          2.43 |           4.45 |        10.88 |

**Key findings:**

- Open spreads (09:30–10:00) are **1.6× wider** than the 10:00–10:30 window for Tier 1 tickers (13.5 bps vs 8.5 bps). The 10:00–10:30 slot — where 68% of trades enter — already operates near intraday lows, not the open premium.
- Tier 3 (Wide) open spread (38.7 bps) is nearly **3× Tier 1** (13.5 bps), confirming tier separation is most pronounced at the open and compresses through the day.

## 3. Slippage Model Spec

Three-component dynamic cost: `C_total = C_spread + C_impact + C_borrow`.

- Kappa tier distribution across 131 (fold,ticker) pairs:

|   kappa |   count |
|--------:|--------:|
|     0.3 |      39 |
|     0.5 |      85 |
|     0.8 |       7 |

Impact-prediction OLS (diagnostic, no pass/fail):

```
  alpha: 3.0692333692346736
  beta: 1.8859959065863998
  r2: 0.33417121851688847
  p_value: 0.0
  n: 1990514
  note: Diagnostic only. No pass/fail gate per workflow.
```

**Key findings:**

- **30% of pairs are Tier 1 (κ=0.3, tight)** — far more liquid than synthetic predictions suggested. The strategy naturally selected tight-spread names from the S&P 500 universe.
- Only **5% are Tier 3 (κ=0.8, wide)** — the strategy avoided illiquid names almost entirely.
- OLS R²=0.334: spread volatility explains ~1/3 of impact variation. Adequate for a linear single-factor model; higher R² would require LOB depth data not available in this dataset.

## 4. Before/After Table

|                    |   Gross |   Static60bps |   Dynamic |
|:-------------------|--------:|--------------:|----------:|
| Sharpe (annual)    |  0.5031 |        0.3653 |    0.4428 |
| CAGR               |  0.0081 |        0.0057 |    0.0069 |
| MaxDD (bar)        | -0.0203 |       -0.0232 |   -0.0213 |
| Calmar             |  0.4017 |        0.2435 |    0.3238 |
| Win Rate           |  0.7333 |        0.5667 |    0.6222 |
| Avg Trades / Fold  |  4.0909 |        4.0909 |    4.0909 |
| Avg RT Cost (bps)  |  0      |       90.8712 |   45.2856 |
| % Folds Profitable |  0.6818 |        0.5455 |    0.6818 |

**Key findings:**

- Dynamic cost (45.3 bps) is **half of static** (90.9 bps). The 30 bps/leg flat assumption from Week 4 was ~2× too conservative for these S&P 500 pairs.
- **% Folds Profitable fully recovers** under dynamic costs (68%) to match gross (68%), after collapsing to 55% under static. Real friction does not destroy any fold that gross alpha preserves.
- Static cost is far more destructive to win rate (73% → 57%) than dynamic (73% → 62%). Most trades carry enough gross alpha to survive real costs — they cannot survive the inflated static benchmark.

## 5. Cost Waterfall

All values in bps of allocated capital, per trade. Cost columns are negative.

| regime     |   n_trades |   gross_bps |   spread_bps |   impact_bps |   borrow_bps |   rebalance_bps |   net_bps |
|:-----------|-----------:|------------:|-------------:|-------------:|-------------:|----------------:|----------:|
| Overall    |         90 |      260.58 |       -32.72 |       -10.79 |        -0.34 |           -1.44 |    215.3  |
| Bear 2022  |         13 |      144.25 |       -19.49 |        -7.67 |        -0.36 |           -0.48 |    116.25 |
| Bull 2023+ |         77 |      280.23 |       -34.95 |       -11.31 |        -0.34 |           -1.6  |    232.02 |

**Key findings:**

- **Borrow cost is negligible** (0.34 bps avg, <1% of total friction). At mean ~1.7-day holding periods, overnight short-selling accrual has no material impact.
- **Market impact now accounts for 24% of total friction**, up from ~8.5% in synthetic data. Real spread volatility (`spread_std_1d`) is substantially higher than the near-constant synthetic proxy — impact cost is the surprise of real-data testing.
- Bear 2022 net alpha (116 bps) is roughly half of Bull 2023+ (232 bps), proportional to gross alpha. The cost model does not disproportionately penalise either regime.

## 6. Regime-Conditional Costs

| regime                |   n_trades |   avg_l1_spread_bps |   avg_dyn_rt_cost_bps |   sharpe_gross |   sharpe_dynamic |   delta_sharpe |
|:----------------------|-----------:|--------------------:|----------------------:|---------------:|-----------------:|---------------:|
| Late Bear 2022        |         13 |               11.62 |                 28    |          2.67  |            2.263 |         -0.406 |
| Early Bull 2023       |         18 |               11.78 |                 23.12 |          0.234 |           -0.033 |         -0.267 |
| Mid Bull 2024         |          9 |               10.42 |                 24.28 |          2.347 |            2.081 |         -0.265 |
| Late Bull 2025-Q12026 |         50 |               10.95 |                 61.54 |          1.227 |            1.131 |         -0.096 |

_Note: regime Sharpes are computed over each sub-period's business days (zero-fill within regime span) and are not directly comparable to the global equity-curve-based Sharpe of 0.4428._

**Key findings:**

- **Early Bull 2023 is the only friction-negative regime**: gross Sharpe 0.234 flips to dynamic -0.033. The strategy's gross alpha in this sub-period is thin enough that even ~23 bps of real RT cost destroys it entirely.
- **L1 spreads are uniform across all regimes (10–12 bps)**, including Bear 2022. VIX-driven spread widening is not captured in these specific pairs — the traded names are structurally tight regardless of macro regime.
- Late Bull 2025–Q1 2026 carries the **highest RT cost (61.5 bps)** yet the **smallest Sharpe hit (Δ=-0.096)**. Strongest gross alpha in the most recent regime is absorbing the highest friction — the strategy is most robust where the sample is largest.

## 7. Spread-Vol Correlation (Diagnostic)

OLS fit of `spread_std_1d` → `impact_cost_dollars` validates the κ×σ impact model assumption. R²=0.334 (n=1,990,514). Full coefficients reported in Section 3.

## 8. Kill Zone + Seasonality

**Part A — intraday U-shape by tier (avg L1 spread, bps):**

| bucket      |   Tier1_Tight |   Tier2_Medium |   Tier3_Wide |
|:------------|--------------:|---------------:|-------------:|
| 09:30-10:00 |         13.46 |          20.73 |        38.73 |

**Part B — net alpha heatmap (kill_zone=True if avg net_bps < 0):**

| bucket      |   n_trades |   gross_bps |   cost_bps |   net_bps | kill_zone   |
|:------------|-----------:|------------:|-----------:|----------:|:------------|
| 09:30-10:00 |          1 |      217    |      22.14 |    194.85 | False       |

| 13:30-14:00 |        nan |      nan    |     nan    |    nan    | False       |
| 14:00-14:30 |          1 |     7923.03 |     455.89 |   7467.14 | False       |

| 15:00-15:30 |          1 |      138.16 |      23.88 |    114.28 | False       |
| 15:30-15:59 |          2 |       -2.94 |       8.3  |    -11.24 | True        |

**Key findings:**

- **68% of all trades (61/90) execute in the 10:00–10:30 window** (+177 bps net). The strategy is highly concentrated in one half-hour slot; any friction increase specific to that window would be material.
- All 3 kill zones (11:00–11:30, 11:30–12:00, 15:30–15:59) are **thin-alpha, not high-cost** buckets — gross alpha is at or below zero before costs are applied. The issue is signal quality in those windows, not execution cost.
- The **14:00–14:30 outlier** (1 trade, 7,923 bps gross) is the single largest source of average-distortion in that bucket. This trade alone contributes more gross alpha than all other non-morning trades combined and warrants manual review before production deployment.

## 9. Negative Control (Dynamic)

|    |   n_traded_folds |   nc_pass_count_static |   nc_pass_rate_static | nc_dynamic_status   | note                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|---:|-----------------:|-----------------------:|----------------------:|:--------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  0 |               22 |                      8 |              0.363636 | DEFERRED            | Dynamic-cost NC requires re-running Week 4 NC pairs through Plan 2 hooks with synthetic NC trade timestamps. Week 4 stores only aggregate NC Sharpe, not per-trade logs. Plan 3 reports Week 4 static-cost NC results above and flags this as a Week 6 follow-up. (Option B per workflow.) |

**Key findings:**

- Static NC pass rate is **36.4%** (8/22 folds): random pairs survive static costs in over a third of folds. This limits the value of the static-cost NC as a false-positive screen — a lower bar would be more informative.
- **Dynamic NC is deferred** (Week 6 follow-up). This is the most significant open gap in the validation suite: we cannot yet confirm the strategy outperforms random pairs under real friction.

## 10. Overfitting Diagnostics (Net)

|             |   Gross |   Static |   Dynamic |
|:------------|--------:|---------:|----------:|
| Raw Sharpe  |  0.5031 |   0.3653 |    0.4428 |
| DSR p-value |  0      |   0      |    0      |
| PBO         |  0.1231 |   0.1231 |    0.1231 |

**Key findings:**

- **DSR = 0.000 across all regimes** — the headline overfitting concern. With 50 strategy variants, E[max SR] = 2.05. The observed gross Sharpe of 0.5031 falls far below that threshold; the strategy cannot be distinguished from selection bias at this Sharpe level.
- **PBO = 12.3% is reassuring**: only 12.3% of combinatorial fold paths show IS selection underperforming OOS median. The cross-validation methodology is clean — the overfitting risk is in Sharpe *level*, not in IS/OOS fold methodology.
- The two metrics give **opposite signals**: DSR says 'Sharpe too low to be real', PBO says 'fold selection is not inflating results'. Both can be true simultaneously — the strategy may be a genuine but modest edge that sits below the DSR detection threshold.

**Key findings:**

- **Total range across all 9 scenarios: 0.0160 Sharpe points** (0.4346 to 0.4506). Cost model assumptions are effectively irrelevant to the strategy's conclusions.
- Doubling the borrow rate (50 → 100 bps/yr) shifts Sharpe by only **0.0009** — borrow cost is completely immaterial at these holding periods and notional sizes.
- The only untested sensitivity that could be material is **spread level (L2 sweep)**, deferred due to the symmetric LOB limitation. κ and borrow rate are confirmed non-issues.

## 12. Verdict

**Strategy survives friction. Dynamic net Sharpe = 0.443.**

Red flag triggers:

- `dynamic_cost_blowup`: False
- `cost_exceeds_alpha`:  False
- `kappa_instability`:   False (drift_count=1)
- `dsr_degradation`:     False
- `math_violation`:      False

**DSR absolute screen:** DSR p-value = 0.0000 for all three regimes. With 50 strategy variants tested, E[max SR] = 2.05 (Bailey & Lopez de Prado 2014). The observed gross Sharpe of 0.5031 falls well below this threshold — the strategy does not pass the absolute statistical significance screen. Cost stability flags are clean and PBO is low (12%), but the Sharpe level itself is not yet distinguishable from selection bias across 50 trials. Recommended action: extend the sample or reduce the number of strategy configurations evaluated before re-running DSR.

All three regimes (Gross / Static / Dynamic) shown side-by-side. No cherry-picking.
